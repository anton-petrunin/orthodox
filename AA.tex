We will construct a compact totally discontinous subset $K\subset\RR^3$ without isolated points  
such that the complement $\RR^3\backslash K$ is not simply connected.
Then the problem will follow
since any compact totally discontinous set and without isolated points
is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

The needed set can be obtained as intersection $K=\bigcap_n K_n$
of a nested sequence 
of sets $K_1\supset K_2\supset\dots$, where each $K_n$ is a union of finite collection of solid tori. 
The construction can be guessed from the first two itarations shown on the picture.

Assume $\Sigma$ contains a closed curve with curvature $1$.

Let us cut the polygon $A_0$ from the plane and glue instead the polygon $A_t$ for small enough $t$.

Note that 
$\Pi$ coincides with Euclidean plane outside of compact region.
The vertices with increasing/decreasing angles of $A_0$ 
correspond to the singular points of $\Pi$ with negative/positive curvature.

Assume we have at least two singular points with positive curvature in $\Pi$.
Choose two of them, say $p$ and $q$ which which lie on the minimal distance from each other. 
Cut $\Pi$ along a geodesic $[pq]$
and patch the hole 
so that in the obtained polyhedral space, say $\Pi'$, 
the points $p$ and $q$ become regular and yet an other singular point apears in the patch. 
The patch is obtained by doubling a triangle in two sides.
This way we can remove all singular points with positive curvature except one.

Assume contrary; i.e., there is a convex polyhedron $P$ which admits a flexible triangulation $\tau$. 
Denote by $P^t$ the continuous deformation of $P$ which moves each triangle $\triangle_1,\dots,\triangle_n$ of $\tau$ 
by motions $m_1^t,\dots,m_n^t$ of $\RR^3$.
Given triangle edge or vertex of $\tau$ we will mark by upper index $t$ the corresponding object in $P^t$; 
for example $\triangle_i^t=m^t_i(\triangle_i)$.

Denote by $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_k$ the vertices of $\tau$.
We can assume that one of the triangles, say $[v_1v_2v_3]$ of $\tau$ does not move in the deformation.

Let us choose a sequence $t_n\to 0$ and set 
\[\eps_n=\max_i\{|v_i^{t_n}-v_i|\}.\leqno{({*})}\]

Prove that if $v_i$ and $v_j$ lie in one face of $P$ then
\[|v_i^{t_n}-v_j^{t_n}|=|v_i-v_j|+O(\eps_n^2).\leqno{({*}{*})}\]

Passing to a subsequence if necessary,
we can assume that the limit
\[w_i=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{v_i^{t_n}-v_i}{\eps_n}\] 
is defined for each $i$.
Note that $w_1=w_2=w_3=0$,
$|w_i|\le 1$ for each $i$ 
and $|w_k|=1$ for some $k$.

Note that from the equation $({*}{*})$ it follows that $w_i$ restricted to the vertices of the original polyhedron gives its  infintesimal deformation;
i.e., 
\[\<v_i-v_j,w_i-w_j\>=0\]
for any edge $[v_iv_j]$ of the polyhedron.
The later contradicts Dehn's theorem on the infinetesimal rigidity of simplicial polyhedron.

Consider a pair of points $v\in V$ and $w\in W$ which realize the minimum of the distance.

Note that the minimizing geodesic $[vw]$ is unique and it is normal to each of the hypersurface at the end points.
In particular the parallel translation of the tangent hyperplane $\T_vV$ along $[vw]$ gives the tangent hyperplane $\T_wW$.

Consider pairs of unit-speed geodesics $\alpha$ and $\beta$ 
in $V$ and $W$ correspondingly 
which start at $v$ and $W$ and go in the parallel directions. 
Set $\ell(t)=|\alpha(t)-\beta(t)|_M$.

Use the second variation formula to show that $\ell''(0)$ has negative average value. 
In particular $\ell''(0)<0$ for a pair $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as above
and therefore  $v$ and $w$ is not a minimal pair, a contradiction.



















\chapter{letter of S. Tabachnikov}

Dear AHTOH, here are my (sorry, much belated!) comments on your list
of geometry problems. I will be happy to provide more details if you
wish. Do you include open problems? Privet, Serezha

1. Spiral. A reference to Kneser's theorem is appropriate: as long as
the curvature is monotonic, the osculating circles are nested.???

2. A curve in a sphere. Isn't it an immediate consequence of integral
geometry (length=const \times average number of intersections with
great circles)?

3.

4. Convex polygon. This is known as Cauchy Lemma; this was the main
ingredient in his proof that convex polyhedra in 3-space are rigid.

5. Convex triangulations. I think, this is discussed, with
references, in Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky book.

6. Short curve in a sphere. Doesn't it follow from integral geometry
that every open interval of this curve doesn't intersect some grat
circle?

7. Transversal foliation. To this I'd add that a non-vanishing
divergence free vector field on a closed 3-mfld with finite
fundamental group is not tangent to any foliation. This is proved in
my 1989 Func. Anal. note.

I don't know whether the following results qualifies for your list.

A. Given partition of a square into triangles of equal areas, the
number of triangles is even. There are many generalizations. E.g.,
the same holds for a centrally symmetric polygon. There is literature
on this subject.

B. Let G be a closed convex plane curve and g a closed immersed curve
inside G. Then average absolute curvature (g) \geq that of G, with
equality iff g is G, possibly traversed more than once. Average
absolute curvature = integral of abs. value of curvature divided by
total length.
For G a circle, this is an old Fary theorem (I know a few proofs);
for arbitrary G this was proved recently (there are two papers).



\chapter{letter of P. Petersen}

Peter Petersen 	to Anton

I'll be happy to make a few corrections.
In the problem a la Abresch-Gromoll you use Minkowski space for finite
dimensional normed vector space. This is a bit confusing to those who
think of Minkowski spaces as space-times!
In the Immerses convex hypersurface problem the third and last question
should say nonnegative (sectional) curvature rather than nonpositive which
is the second question.
In Fixed points of conformal mappings the dimension should be even? The
antipodal map on S^3 has no fixed points. Actually you might want to say
that in even dimensions the map is orientation preserving and in odd
dimensions it is orientation reversing. 
Then the problem should be correct.

And here are two problems I have always liked.
1. Show that if a
simply connected
compact positively curved manifold admits a totally geodesic hypersurface,
then it is a sphere. Actually one just needs to know that the hypersurface
is two sided.
2. Show that two minimal hypersufaces in positive Ricci curvature must
intersect.
