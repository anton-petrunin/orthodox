\chapter{Comparison geometry}

In this chapter we consider Riemannian manifolds with curvature bounds.

This chapter is very demanding;
we assume that the reader is familiar with  Jacobi fields, 
Shape operator and second fundamental form, 
equations of Riccati and Jacobi,
comparison theorems and Morse theory.
The classical book \cite{cheeger-ebin} covers all the  necessary  material.

\subsection*{Geodesic immersion\hard}

An isometric immesion $\iota\:N\looparrowright M$ from one Riemannian manifold to an other is called \index{totally geodesic}\emph{totally geodesic} if it maps any geodesic in $N$ to a geodesic in $M$.

\begin{pr}{\hard}{Geodesic immersion}
\label{Geodesic immersion}
Let $M$ be a simply connected positively curved Riemannian manifold and $\iota\:N\looparrowright M$ be a totally geodesic immersion.
Assume that 
\[\dim N>\tfrac 12\cdot \dim M.\]
Prove that $\iota$ is an embedding.
\end{pr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parit{Semisolution.}
Set $n=\dim N$, $m=\dim M$.

Fix a smooth increasing strictly concave function $\phi$.
Consider the function $f=\phi\circ\dist_N$.

Note that if $f$ is smooth at some point $x\in M$ 
then the Hessian of $f$ at $x$ (briefly $\Hess_xf$)
has at least $n+1$ negative eigenvalues.

Moreover, at any point $x\notin \iota(N)$ the same holds in the barrier sense.
That is, there is a smooth function $h$ defined on $M$
such that $h(x)=f(x)$, $h(y)\ge f(y)$ for any $y$
and $\Hess_xh$ has at least $n+1$ negative eigenvalues.

Use that $m< 2\cdot n$ and the described property to prove the following
analog of Morse lemma for $f$.

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item[$({*})$]
Given $x\notin \iota(N)$ there is a neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that the set 
\[U_-=\set{z\in U}{f(z)<f(x)}\] is simply connected.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
%???why

Since $M$ is simply connected,
any closed curve in $\iota(N)$
can be contracted by a disc, say $s_0\:\mathbb D\to M$.

Applying the claim $({*})$, one can construct an $f$-decreasing homotopy which starts at $s_0$ and ends in $\iota(N)$.
That is,
a homotopy $s_t\:\mathbb D\to M$, $t\in [0,1]$ 
such that $s_t(\partial \mathbb D)\subset \iota(N)$ for any $t$ 
and $s_1(\mathbb D)\subset \iota(N)$.
It follows that $\iota(N)$ is simply connected.

Finally note that if $\iota\:N\to M$ has a self-intersection,
then the image
$\iota(N)$ is not simply connected.
Hence the result follows.\qeds


The statement was proved by 
Fuquan Fang, 
S\'ergio Mendon\c{c}a 
and Xiaochun Rong in \cite{FMR}.
The main idea was discovered by 
Burkhard Wilking \cite[see][]{wilking-2003}.

\subsection*{Geodesic hypersurface}

The totally geodesic embedding is defined before the previous problem.

\begin{pr}{\easy}{Geodesic hypersurface}\label{Geodesic hypersurface}
Assume a compact connected positively curved manifold $M$ has a totally geodesic embedded hypersurface.
Show that $M$ or its double cover is homeomorphic to the sphere.
\end{pr}

\subsection*{If convex, then embedded}

\begin{pr}{}{If convex, then embedded}\label{If convex then embedded} 
Let $M$ be a complete simply connected Riemannian manifold 
with non-positive curvature 
and dimension at least $3$.
Prove that any immersed locally convex
compact hypersurface $\Sigma$ in $M$ is embedded.
\end{pr}

Let us summarize some statements about complete simply connected Riemannian manifolds 
with non-positive curvature; assume $M$ is such a manifold.

By Cartan--Hadamard theorem, for any point $p\in M$
the exponential map $\exp_p\:\T_p\to M$ is a diffeomorphism.
In particular $M$ is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space of the same dimension.
In particular, any geodesic in $M$ is minimizing,
and any two points in $M$ are connected by unique minimizing geodesic,

Further, $M$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space; that is, it satisfies a global angle comparison which we are about to describe.
Assume $[xyz]$ is a triangle in $M$;
that is, three distinct points connected pairwise by geodesics.
Consider its model triangle $[\tilde x\tilde y\tilde z]$ in the Euclidean plane;
that is a triangle with the coresponding side lengths as in $[xyz]$.
Then each angle in $[xyz]$ can not axceed the corresponding angle in $[\tilde x\tilde y\tilde z]$.
This inequality can be written as
\[\tilde\measuredangle(y\,^x_z)\ge\measuredangle\hinge yxz,\]
where $\measuredangle\hinge yxz$ denotes the angle of the hinge $\hinge yxz$ formed by two geodesics $[yx]$ and $[yz]$ 
and $\tilde\measuredangle(y\,^x_z)$ denotes the corresponding angle in the model triangle $[\tilde x\tilde y\tilde z]$.

From this comparison it follows that any connected closed locally convex sets in $M$ is globally convex.
In particular, if $\Sigma$ is embedded then it bounds a convex set.

\begin{pr}{\hard}{Immersed ball}\label{Immersed ball}
Prove that any immersed locally convex
hypersurface $\iota\:\Sigma\looparrowright M$

That is, there is an immersion of a closed ball $f\:\bar B^m\looparrowright M$ and a diffeomorphism $h\:\Sigma\to\partial \bar B^m$
such that $\iota=f\circ h$.
\end{pr}

\subsection*{Minimal surface in the sphere}

\label{minimal surface}
A  smooth $n$-dimensional surface $\Sigma$ in
an $m$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ is called minimal
if it locally minimized the $n$-dimensional area;
that is, sufficiently small regions of $\Sigma$ do not admit area decreasing deformations with fixed boundary.

The minimal surfaces can be also defined via mean curvature vector as follows.
Let $\T=\T\,\Sigma$ and $\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{N}\,\Sigma$ correspondingly tangent and normal bundle.
Let $s$ denotes the second fundamental form of $\Sigma$;
it is a quadratic from on $\T$ with values in $\mathrm{N}$,
see the remark after problem ``Hypercurve'' below. 
Given an orthonormal basis $(e_i)$ in $\T_x$, 
set 
$$H_x=\sum_i s(e_i,e_i)\in \mathrm{N}_x.$$
The vector $H_x$ lies in the normal space $\mathrm{N}_x$
and it does not depend on the choice of orthonormal basis $(e_i)$.
This vector $H_x$ is called the mean curvature vector at $x\in \Sigma$. 

We say that $\Sigma$ is \index{minimal surface}\emph{minimal} if $H\equiv 0$.

\begin{pr}{}{Minimal surface in the sphere}\label{almgren} 
Let $\Sigma$ be a closed $n$-dimensional 
minimal surface
in $\mathbb{S}^m$.
Prove that
$\vol_n \Sigma\ge \vol_n \mathbb{S}^n$.
\end{pr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Hypercurve}

The Riemannian curvature tensor $R$
can be viewed as an operator $\text{\bf R}$ on the space of tangent bi-vectors $\bigwedge^2 \T$;
it is uniquely defined by identity
$$\langle\mathbf{R}(X\wedge Y),V\wedge W\rangle
=
\langle R(X,Y)V,W\rangle.$$
The operator $\mathbf{R}\:\bigwedge^2 \T\to \bigwedge^2 \T$ is called \index{curvature operator}\emph{curvature operator} and it is said to be {}\emph{positive definite} if
$\langle\mathbf{R}(\phi),\phi\rangle>0$ for all non zero
bi-vector $\phi\in\bigwedge^2 \T$.


\begin{pr}{}{Hypercurve}\label{codim=2}
Let $M^m\hookrightarrow \RR^{m+2}$ be a closed smooth $m$-dimensional
submanifold and let  $g$ be the  induced Riemannian metric on $M^m$.
Assume that sectional curvature of $g$ is positive.
Prove that the curvature operator of $g$ is positive definite.
\end{pr}

The second fundamental form for manifolds of arbitrary codimension
which we are about to describe 
might help to solve this problem.

Assume $M$ is a smooth submanifold in $\RR^m$.
Given a point $p\in M$ denote by $\T_p$ and $\mathrm{N}_p=\T_p^\bot$
the tangent and normal spaces of $M$ at $p$.
The \index{second fundamental form}\emph{second fundamental form}\label{page:second fundamental form} of $M$ at $p$ is defined as $$s(X,Y)=(\nabla_X Y)^\bot,$$ 
where $(\nabla_X Y)^\bot$ denotes the orthogonal projection of covariant derivative $\nabla_X Y$ onto the normal bundle.

The curvature tensor of $M$ can be found from the second fundamental form using the following  formula
\[\langle R(X,Y)Y,X\rangle=\langle s(X,X),s(Y,Y)\rangle-\langle s(X,Y),s(X,Y)\rangle,\]
which is direct generalization of the formula for Gauss curvature of surface.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Horosphere}

We say that a Riemannian manifold has negatively pinched sectional curvature, if its sectional curvature at any point in any sectional direction lies in  $[-a^2, -b^2]$, for fixed constants $a>b>0$.

Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold
and $\gamma$ is a ray in $M$; 
that is, $\gamma\:[0, \infty)\to M$ is a minimizing unit-speed geodesic.

The \index{Busemann function}\emph{Busemann function} $b_\gamma\:M\to\RR$ is defined by
$$b_\gamma(p)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\left(|p-\gamma(t)|_M-t\right).$$
From the triangle inequality, 
the expression under the limit is non-increasing in $t$; 
therefore  the limit above is defined for any $p$.

A \index{horosphere}\emph{horosphere} in $M$ is defined as a level set of a Busemann function
in $M$.

We say that a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ has \index{polynomial volume growth}\emph{polynomial volume growth} if for some (and therefore any) $p\in M$, 
we have 
$$\vol B(p,r)_M\z\le C\cdot (r^k+1),$$ 
where $B(p,r)_M$ denotes the ball in $M$ and  $C$, $k$ are real constants.

\begin{pr}{}{Horosphere}\label{Horosphere} Let $M$ be a complete simply connected manifold with negatively pin\-ched sectional curvature
and $\Sigma\subset M$ be an horosphere in $M$.
Show that
$\Sigma$ with the induced intrinsic metric

\end{pr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Minimal spheres}


Recall that two subsets $A$ and $B$ in a metric space $X$ are called \index{equidistant sets}\emph{equidistant} if the distance function $\dist_A\:X\to\RR$ is constant on $B$ and $\dist_B$ is constant on $A$.

The minimal surfaces are defined on page \pageref{minimal surface}.

\begin{pr}{}{Minimal spheres}\label{Minimal spheres}

Assume $\mathbb S^1$ acts isometrically on a $4$-dimensional positively curved closed Riemannian manifold.
Show that the action 
has at most $3$ isolated fixed points.
\end{pr}

The following statement might be useful.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $(M,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $\ge 1$ which admits a continuous isometric action of $\mathbb S^1$, 
then $A=(M,g)/\mathbb S^1$ is an Alexandrov space with curvature $\ge 1$;
that is, the conclusion of Toponogov comparison theorem holds in $A$. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Energy minimizer}

Let $F$ be a smooth map from a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ to a Riemannian manifold $N$.
Then energy functional of $F$ is defined as
\[E(F)=\int\limits_M |d_xF|^2\cdot d_x\vol_M.\]
If $(a_{i,j})$ denote the components 
of the differential $d_xF$ 
written in the orthonormal bases of the tangent spaces $\T_xM$ and $\T_{F(x)}N$,
then 
\[|d_xF|^2=\sum_{i,j}a_{i,j}^2.\]

\begin{pr}{}{Energy minimizer}\label{Energy minimizer}

Show that the injectivity radius of $(M,g)$ is at most $\pi$.
\end{pr}

A solution use that geodesic flow on the tangent bundle to a Riemannian manifold preserves the volume form; this is a corollary of Liouville's theorem on phase volume.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Almost flat manifold}

\emph{Nil-manifolds} form the minimal class of manifolds which includes a point, and has the following property:  
the total space of any principle $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a nil-manifold is a nil-manifold. 

The nil-manifolds can be also defined as the quotients of a connected nilpotent Lie group by a lattice.

A compact Riemannian manifold $M$ is called $\eps$-flat if its sectional curvature at all points in all directions lie in the interval $[-\eps,\eps]$. 

The main theorem of Gromov in \cite{gromov-almost-flat}, 
states that for any positive integer $n$ there is $\eps>0$ such that any $\eps$-flat compact $n$-dimensional manifold with diameter at most $1$ admits a finite cover by a nil-manifold.
A more detailed proof can be found in \cite{buser-karcher}
and a more precise statement can be found in \cite{ruh}.

\begin{pr}{}{Almost flat manifold}\label{almost-flat}

\parbf{Geodesic hypersurface.}
Let $\Sigma$ be the totally geodesic embedded hypersurface in the positively curved manifold $M$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\Sigma$ is connected.%
\footnote{In fact, by Frankel's theorem [see page \ref{page:frankel}] $\Sigma$ is connected.}

The complement $M\backslash\Sigma$ has one or two connected components.
First let us show that if the number of connected components is two, 
then $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere.

By cutting $M$ along $\Sigma$ 
we get two manifolds
with geodesic boundaries.
It is sufficient to show that each of them is homeomorphic to a Euclidean ball.

Fix one of these manifolds, and denote it by $N$;
denote by $f\:N\z\to\RR$ the distance functions to the boundary $\partial N$.
By Riccati equation $\Hess f\le 0$ at any smooth point,
and for any point the same holds in the barrier sense.
It follows that $f$ is concave.

Note that $f$ is smooth in a small neighborhood of $\partial N$.
Given $\eps>0$, set
\[N_\eps=\set{x\in N}{f(x)\ge \eps}.\]
Note that for all small $\eps>0$, the set $N_\eps$ is a convex subset of $N$ with smooth boundary
which is diffeomorphic to whole $N$.

Take strictly concave increasing function, say $\phi(x)=\ln x$.
It is easy to check that $\Hess (\phi\circ f_i)< 0$ in the interior of $N$.
In other words $\phi\circ f_i$ is stritly concave in the interior of $N$.

Fix small $\eps>0$ an smooth $\phi\circ f$ in a neigborhood of $N_\eps$ keeping it concave. 
This can be done by applying the smoothing theorem of Greene and Wu \cite[see Theorem~2 in][]{greene-wu}.

After the smoothing, the obtained strictly concave function, say $h$ has single critical point which is its maximum.
In particular by Morse lemma, we get that if the set  
\[N'_s=\set{x\in N}{h(x)\ge s}\]
is not empty and lies in $N_\eps$ then it is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean ball.

For appropriately chousen smoothng, a set $N'_s$ can be made arbitrary close to $N_\eps$;
moreover, its boundary $\partial N'_s$ can be made arbitrary close in the $C^\infty$-metric to $\partial N_\eps$.
It follows that $N_\eps$ as well as $N$ are diffeomorphic to a Euclidean ball.
This finishes the proof of the first case.

Now assume $M\backslash\Sigma$ is connected.
In this case there is a double cover $\tilde M$ of $M$
which induce a double cover $\tilde\Sigma$ of $\Sigma$
and so that $\tilde M$ contains a geodesic hypersurface $\tilde\Sigma$ which divides $\tilde M$ into two connected components. 
From the case which already has been considered, $\tilde M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere;
hence the second case follows.
\qeds

The problem was suggested by Peter Petersen.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{If convex, then embedded.}
Set 
\[m=\dim \Sigma=\dim M-1\]

Given a point in $p$ on $\Sigma$ 
denote by $p_r$ the point on distance $r$ from $p$
which lies on the geodesic starting from $p$ in the outer normal direction to $\Sigma$.
Note that for fixed $r\ge 0$,
the points $p_r$ sweep an immersed locally convex hypersurface which we denote by $\Sigma_r$.



\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{54 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(0 mm),r(3 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/sigma-r(1)}

\lbl[t]{31.5,15.5;$z$}
%\lbl[r]{18.5,34;{\small $\phi_r(x)$}}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Fix $z\in M$. 
Denote by $d$ the maximal distance from $z$ to the points in $\Sigma$.
Note that 
any point on $\Sigma_r$
lies on a distance at least $r-d$ from $z$.

By comparison, 
\[\sin\measuredangle\hinge{p_r}zp\le \tfrac dr.\]
In particular, for large $r$, 
each infinite geodesic starting at $z$ intersects $\Sigma_r$ transversally.

The space of geodesics starting from $z$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^m$.
Therefore the map which send a point $x\in \Sigma_r$ to a geodesic from $z$ thru $x$ induce a local diffeomorphism $\phi_r\:\Sigma_r\to\mathbb{S}^m$.

Since $\Sigma_r$ is connected and $m\ge 2$, it follows that $\phi_r$ is a diffeomorphism.
Therefore $\Sigma_r$ is star-shaped with center at $z$.
In particular embedded and bounds a convex region (see the discussion after the formulation).

By an open-closed argument, the same holds for all $r\ge 0$.
Hence the result follows.\qeds

The problem is due to Stephanie Alexander \cite[see][]{alexander}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Immersed ball.}
Equip $\Sigma$ with the induced intrinsic metric.
Denote by $\kappa$ the lower bound for principle curvatures of $\Sigma$.
Note that we can assume that $\kappa>0$.

Fix sufficiently small $\eps=\eps(M,\kappa)>0$.
Given $p\in \Sigma$ denote by $\Delta(p)$ the $\eps$-ball in $\Sigma$ centered at $p$.
Consider the lift $\tilde h_p\:\Delta(p)\to \T_{h(p)}$ along the exponential map $\exp_{h(p)}\:\T_{h(p)}\to M$.
More precisely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect each point $q\in \Delta(p)\subset \Sigma$ to $p$
by a minimizing geodesic  path $\gamma_q\:[0,1]\to \Sigma$
\item Consider the lifting $\tilde\gamma_q$ in $\T_{h(p)}$; 
that is, the curve such that $\tilde\gamma_q(0)=0$ 
and $\exp_{h(p)}\circ\,\tilde\gamma_q(t)=\gamma_q(t)$ for any $t\in[0,1]$.
 \item Set $\tilde h(q)=\tilde\gamma_q(1)$.
\end{enumerate}

Show that all the hypersurfaces $\tilde h_p(\Delta(p))\subset \T_{h(p)}$ has principle curvatures at least $\tfrac\kappa2$.

Use the same idea as in the solution of ``Immersed surface'' [page ~\pageref{Immersed surface}] to show that 
one can fix $\eps\z=\eps(M,\kappa)>0$ such that the restriction of $\tilde h_p|_{\Delta(p)}$ is injective.
Conclude that the restriction $h|_{\Delta(p)}$ is injective for any $p\in\Sigma$.

Now consider locally equidistant surfaces $\Sigma_t$ in the inward direction for small $t$. 
The principle curvatures of $\Sigma_t$ remain at least $\kappa$ in the barrier sense.
By the same argument as above, any $\eps$-ball in $\Sigma_t$
is embedded.

Applying open-closed argument we get a one parameter family of locally convex locally equidistant surfaces $\Sigma_t$
for $t$ in the maximal interval $[0,a]$,
where the surface $\Sigma_a$ degenerates to a point, say $p$. 

To construct the immersion $\partial \bar B^m\looparrowright M$,
take the point $p$ as the image of the center $\bar B^m$ 
and take the surfaces $\Sigma_t$ as the restrictions of the  embedding to the spheres;
the existence of the immersion follows from the Morse lemma.\qeds

As you see from the picture, 
the analogous statement does not hold in the two-dimensional case.

The proof presented above was indicated in the lectures of Mikhael Gromov \cite[see][]{gromov-SGMC} and written rigorously by Jost Eschenburg in \cite{eschenburg}.

A variation of Gromov's proof 
was obtained independently by Ben Andrews in \cite{andrews}.
Instead of equidistant deformation, 
he uses a so called \index{inverse mean curvature flow}\emph{inverse mean curvature flow};
this way one has to perform some calculations to show that convexity survives in the flow, 
but one does not have to worry about non-smoothness of the hypersurfaces $\Sigma_t$.

\leqno({*})\]

Prove that for any $x\in \partial U_r$ we have
\[H_r(x)\ge \tilde H_r,\] 
where $H_r(x)$ denotes the mean curvature of $\partial U_r$  at a point $x$
and $\tilde H_r$ is the mean curvature of $\partial\tilde U_r$,
the latter is the same at all points.

Set 
\begin{align*}
a(r)&=\vol_{m-1} \partial U_r,
&
\tilde a(r)&=\vol_{m-1} \partial\tilde U_r,
\\
v(r)&=\vol_m U_r,
&
\tilde v(r)&=\vol_m \tilde U_r.
\intertext{by the coarea formula,}
\tfrac d{dr} v(r)&\aall a(r),
&
\tfrac d{dr}\tilde v(r)&=\tilde a(r).
\end{align*}
Note that
\begin{align*}\tfrac d{dr}a(r)&\le \int\limits_{\partial U_r} H_r(x)\cdot d_x\vol_{m-1}\le
\\
&\le a(r)\cdot \tilde H_r
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
\tfrac d{dr}\tilde a(r)
&= \tilde a(r)\cdot \tilde H_r.
\intertext{It follows that}
\frac {v''(r)}{v(r)}&\le \frac {\tilde v''(r)}{\tilde v(r)}
\end{align*}
for almost all $r$. 
Therefore
\[v(r)\le\frac{\area\Sigma}{\area \tilde\Sigma}\cdot \tilde v(r)\]

for any $r>0$.

According to $({*})$,
\[v(\tfrac\pi2)=\tilde v(\tfrac\pi2)=\vol\mathbb{S}^m.\]
Hence the result follows.\qeds

This problem is the geometric part of the isoperimetric inequality proved by Frederick Almgren in \cite{almgren}.
The argument is similar to 
the proof of isometric inequality for manifolds with positive Ricci curvature
given by Mikhael Gromov in \cite{gromov-apendix}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Hypercurve.}
Fix $p\in M$.
Denote by $s$ 
the second fundamental form of $M$ at $p$.
Recall that $s$ is a symmetric bi-linear form on the tangent space $\T_pM$ of $M$ with values in the normal space $\mathrm{N}_pM$ to $M$, see page~\ref{page:second fundamental form}.

Note that the normal space $\mathrm{N}_pM$ is two-dimensional.

Prove that if the sectional curvature of $M$ is positive, 
then
\[\<s(X,X),s(Y,Y)\> > 0\leqno({*})\]
for any pair of nonzero vectors $X,Y\in\T_pM$.

Show that $({*})$ implies that there is an orthonormal basis $e_1,e_2$ in $\mathrm{N}_pM$ 
such that the real-valued quadratic forms 
\begin{align*}
s_1(X,X)&=\<s(X,X),e_1\>,
&
s_2(X,X)&=\<s(X,X),e_2\>
\end{align*}
are positive definite.

Note that the curvature operators $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
defined by the following identity
\[R_{i}(X\wedge Y), V\wedge W\rangle 
=s_i(X,W)\cdot s_i(Y,V)-s_i(X,V)\cdot s_i(Y,W),\]
 are positive.
Finally, note that $R_{1}+R_{2}$ is the curvature operator of $M$ at $p$.\qeds

The problem is due to Alan Weinstein \cite[see][]{weinstein}.
Note that from \cite{micallef-moore}/\cite{boehm-wilking} it follows that
that the universal cover of $M$ is homeomorphic/diffeomorphic to a standard sphere.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Horosphere.}
Set 
$m=\dim \Sigma=\dim M-1$.

Let $b\:M\to\RR$ be the Busemann function such that $\Sigma=b^{-1}(\{0\})$.
Set  $\Sigma_r=b^{-1}(\{r\})$, so $\Sigma_0=\Sigma$.

Let us equip each $\Sigma_r$ with induced Riemannian metric.
Note that all $\Sigma_r$ have bounded curvature.
In particular, the unit ball in $\Sigma_r$ has volume bounded above by a universal constant, say $v_0$.
 

Given $x\in \Sigma$ denote by $\gamma_x$ 
the unit-speed geodesic
such that $\gamma_x(0)=x$ and $b(\gamma_x(t))=t$ for any $t$.
Consider the map $\phi_{r}\:\Sigma\to\Sigma_r$ defined as
$\phi_r\:x\mapsto \gamma_x(r)$.

Notice that $\phi_r$ is a bi-Lipschitz map with the Lipschitz constants $e^{a\cdot r}$ and $e^{b\cdot r}$.
In particular, the ball of radius $R$ in $\Sigma$ is mapped by $\phi_r$
to a ball of radius $e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R$ in $\Sigma_r$.
Therefore
\[\vol_m B(x,R)_\Sigma\le e^{m\cdot b\cdot r}\cdot \vol_m B(x,e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R)_{\Sigma_r}\]
for any $R,r>0$.
Taking $e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R=1$, we get
\[\vol_m B(x,R)_\Sigma\le v_0\cdot R^{m\cdot \frac ba}\]
for any $R\ge1$. 
Hence the statement follows.
\qedsf

The problem was suggested by Vitali Kapovitch.

There are examples of horospheres as above with degree of polynomial growth higher than $m$.
For example, consider the horosphere $\Sigma$ in the
the complex hyperbolic space 
of real dimension $4$.
Clearly $m=\dim \Sigma=3$, but the degree of its volume growth is $4$.

In this case $\Sigma$ is isometric to the Heisenberg group defined below with a left-invariant metric.
It instructive to show that any such metric has volume  growth of degree $4$.

\index{Heisenberg group}\emph{Heisenberg group}
is the group of $3\times3$ upper triangular matrices of the form
\[\begin{pmatrix}
 1 & a & c\\
 0 & 1 & b\\
 0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{pmatrix}\]
under the operation of matrix multiplication. 
                                                      



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Minimal spheres.}
Choose a pair of sufficiently close minimal spheres $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$,
say assume that the distance $a$ between $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ is strictly smaller than the injectivity radius of the manifold.
Note that in this case there is a bijection $\Sigma\to \Sigma'$, which will be denoted by $p\mapsto p'$ such that the distance $|p-p'|=a$ for any $p\in\Sigma$.

Let $\iota_p\:\T_p\to\T_{p'}$ be the parallel translation along the (necessary unique) minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $p'$.
Use the hairy ball theorem 
to show that there is a pair $(p,p')$ such that $\iota_p(\T_p\Sigma)=\T_{p'}\Sigma'$.

Consider pairs of unit-speed geodesics $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ 
in $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$  
which start at $p$ and $p'$ correspondingly
and go in the parallel directions, say $\nu$ and $\nu'$. 
Set $\ell_\nu(t)=|\alpha(t)-\alpha'(t)|$.

Use the second variation formula together with the lower bound on Ricci curvature
to show that $\ell_\nu''(0)$ has negative average for all tangent directions $\nu$ to $\Sigma$ at $p$. 
In particular $\ell_\nu''(0)<0$ for a pair $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ as above.
It follows that there are points $v\in\Sigma$ near $p$ 
and $v'\in\Sigma'$ near $p'$
such that 
\[|v-v'|<|p-p'|,\]
a contradiction.\qeds

Likely, any compact positively curved 
4-dimensional manifold
cannot contain a pair of equidistant spheres.
The argument above implies that the distance between such a pair has to exceed the injectivity radius of the manifold.


The problem was suggested by Dmitri Burago.
Here is a short list of classical problems with use second variation formula in similar fission:
\begin{itemize}
\item Synge's problem \cite[see][]{synge}.
\begin{itemize}
 \item {\it Any compact even-dimensional orientable manifold with positive sectional curvature is
simply connected.}
\end{itemize}
\item Frankel's problems \cite[see][]{frankel}.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Any two compact minimal hypersurfaces in a Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature must intersect.}
\item \label{page:frankel} {\it Assume $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ be two compact geodesic submanifolds in a manifold with positive sectional curvature $M$ and 
\[\dim \Sigma_1+\dim \Sigma_2\ge \dim M.\] 
Show that $\Sigma_1\cap\Sigma_2\ne\emptyset$.}
\end{itemize}
\item Bochner's problem \cite[see][]{bochner}.
\begin{itemize}
\item{\it  Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold with negative Ricci curvature.
Prove that $(M,g)$ does not admit an isometric $\mathbb{S}^1$-action.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The problem ``Geodesic immersion'' [page \pageref{Geodesic immersion}] can be considered as further development of the idea.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Positive curvature and symmetry.}
Let $M$ be a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold with isometric $\mathbb{S}^1$-action.
Consider the quotient space $X=M/\mathbb{S}^1$.
Note that $X$ is a positively curved 3-dimensional Alexandrov space.
In particular the angle $\measuredangle\hinge xyz$ between any two geodesics $[xy]$ and $[xz]$ is defined
and for any non-degenerate triangle $[xyz]$ 
formed by the minimizing geodesics $[xy]$, $[yz]$ and $[zx]$  in $X$ we have
\[\measuredangle\hinge xyz+\measuredangle\hinge yzx+\measuredangle\hinge zxy> \pi.
\leqno({*})\]

Assume $p\in X$ corresponds to a fixed point of $\mathbb{S}^1$-action.
Show that 
for any three geodesics $[px]$, $[py]$ and $[pz]$ in $X$ we have
\[\measuredangle\hinge pxy+\measuredangle\hinge pyz+\measuredangle\hinge pzx\le \pi.\leqno({*}{*})\]
and
\[\measuredangle\hinge pxy, \measuredangle\hinge pyz, \measuredangle\hinge pzx\le \tfrac\pi2.\leqno(\asterism)\]

Arguing by contradiction,
assume that there are 4 fixed points $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ and $q_4$.
Connect each pair $q_i\ne q_j$ by a minimizing geodesic $[q_iq_j]$.

Denote by $\omega$ the sum of all 12 angles of the type  $\measuredangle\hinge{q_i}{q_j}{q_k}$.
By $(\asterism)$, each triangle $[q_iq_jq_k]$ is non-degenerate.
Therefore by $({*})$, we have
\[\omega>4\cdot\pi.\]
Applying $({*}{*})$ at each vertex $q_i$, we have 
\[\omega\le 4\cdot\pi,\]
a contradiction.\qeds


The problem is due to 
Wu-Yi Hsiang 
and Bruce Kleiner 
\cite[see][]{hsiang-kleiner}.
The connection of this proof to Alexandrov geometry was noticed by Karsten Grove in \cite{grove}.
An interesting new twist of the idea 
is given by 
Karsten Grove 
and Burkhard Wilking 
in  \cite{grove-wilking}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Energy minimizer.}
Denote by $\mathcal{U}$ the unit tangent bundle over $\RP^m$
and by $\mathcal{L}$ the space of projective lines in $\ell\:\RP^1\to \RP^m$.
The spaces $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ 
have dimensions $2\cdot m-1$ 
and $2\cdot(m-1)$
correspondingly.


According to Liouville's theorem on phase volume, the identity
\[\int\limits_{\mathcal{U}}f(v)\cdot d_v\vol_{2\cdot m-1}
=
\int\limits_{\mathcal{L}}d_\ell\vol_{2\cdot(m-1)}\cdot\int\limits_{\RP^1} f(\ell'(t))\cdot dt\]
holds for any integrable function $f\:\mathcal{U}\to\RR$.

Let $F\:\RP^m\to\RP^m$ be a smooth map.
Note that up to a multiplicative constant,
the energy of $F$ can be expressed the following way
\[\int\limits_{\mathcal{U}} |dF(v)|^2\cdot d_v\vol_{2m-1}
=
\int\limits_{\mathcal{L}}d_\ell\vol_{2\cdot(m-1)}\cdot\int\limits_{\RP^1} |[d(F\circ \ell)](t)|^2\cdot dt.\]

The result follows since
\[\int\limits_{\RP^1} |[d(F\circ \ell)](t)|^2\cdot dt\ge \pi\]
for any line $\ell\:\RP^1\to \RP^m$.\qeds

\label{page:liouville}
The problem is due to Christopher Croke \cite[see][]{croke-energy}. 
He uses the same idea to show that the identity map on $\CP^m$ is energy minimizing in its homotopy class.
For $\mathbb S^m$, an analogous statement does not hold if $m\ge 3$.
In fact, 
if a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ 
has dimension at least 3 
and $\pi_1M=\pi_2M=0$,
then the identity map on $M$ is homotopic 
to a map with arbitrary small energy;
the latter was shown by Brian White in \cite{white}.

The same idea is used to prove Loewner's inequality on the volume in of $\RP^m$ with metric conformally equivalent to the canonical one \cite[see][]{gromov-filling}.
Among the other applications, 
the sharp isoperimetric inequality for 
4-dimensional Hadamard manifolds;
it was proved by Christopher Croke in \cite{croke-4d},
see also \cite{croke-eigenvalue}.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Curvature vs. injectivity radius.}
We will show that 
if the injectivity radius of the manifold $(M,g)$ is at least $\pi$,
then the average of sectional curvatures on $(M,g)$ is at most $1$.
This is equivalent to the problem.

Fix a point $p\in M$ and two orthonormal vectors $U,V\in\T_p M$.
Consider the geodesic $\gamma$ in $M$ such that $\gamma'(0)=U$.

Set $U_t=\gamma'(t)\in \T_{\gamma(t)}$ 
and let $V_t\in \T_{\gamma(t)}$ be the parallel translation of $V=V_0$ along $\gamma$.


Consider the field $W_t=\sin t\cdot V_t$ on $\gamma$.
Set 
\begin{align*}
\gamma_\tau(t)&=\exp_{\gamma(t)} (\tau\cdot W_t),
\\
\ell(\tau)&=\length(\gamma_\tau|_{[0,\pi]}),
\\
q(U,V)&=\ell''(0).
\end{align*}
Note that
$$q(U,V)
=
\int\limits_{0}^\pi [(\cos t)^2-K(U_t,V_t)\cdot (\sin t)^2]\cdot dt,
\leqno({*})$$
where $K(U,V)$ is the sectional curvature 
in the direction spanned by $U$ and $V$. 

Since any geodesics of length $\pi$ is minimizing,
we get $q(U,V)\ge0$ for any pair of orthonormal vectors $U$ and $V$.
It follows that average value of the right hand side in $({*})$ is non-negative.

By Liouville's theorem on phase volume, while taking the average of $({*})$, we can switch the order of integrals;
therefore  
\[0\le \tfrac\pi2\cdot(1-\bar{K}),\]
where $\bar{K}$ denotes the average of sectional curvatures on $(M,g)$.
Hence the result follows.\qeds

The problem illustrates the idea of Eberhard Hopf \cite[see][]{hopf-conjugate}
which was developed further by Leon Green in \cite{green}.
Hopf used it to show that a metric on torus without conjugate points must be flat
and Green showed that average of sectional curvature on closed manifold without conjugate points can not be positive.

More applications of Liouville's theorem on phase volume discussed in the comments the solution of ``Energy minimizer'', page~\pageref{page:liouville}.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Almost flat manifold.}
First prove that for given $\eps>0$, 
there is big enough $m$ and $m\times m$ integer matrix 
$A$ such that all its eigenvalues are $\eps$-close to $1$. 

Consider $(m+1)$-dimensional manifold $S$ obtained from $\TT^m\times [0,1]$ by gluing $\TT^m\times 0$ to $\TT^m\times 1$ along the map given by $A$.

Show that $S$ does not admit a finite cover by a nill-manifold.

Assuming that $\eps$ is small,
show that $S$ admits a metric with curvature and diameter sufficiently small.\qeds

\label{page-sol:almost-flat}
This example was constructed 
by Galina Guzhvina in \cite{guzhvina}.

It is expected that for small enough $\eps>0$,
a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of any dimension 
with  $\diam(M,g)\le 1$ and $|K_g|\le \eps$ cannot be simply connected,
here $K_g$ denotes the sectional curvature of $g$.

The latter does not hold with the condition $K_g\le \eps$ instead.
In fact, 
for any $\eps>0$,
there is a metric $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^3$ 
with $K_g\le \eps$ and $\diam(\mathbb{S}^3,g)\le 1$.
This example was originally constructed by Mikhael Gromov in \cite{gromov-almost-flat}; 
a simplified proof was given by 
Peter Buser
and Detlef Gromoll in \cite{buser-gromoll}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Approximation of a quotient.}
Note that $G$ admits an embedding into a compact connected Lie group $H$, say we can assume $H=\SO(n)$, for large enough $n$.

Fix a $\kappa\le 0$ such that the curvature bound of $(M,g)$ is bounded below by $\kappa$.

The bi-invariant metric $h$ on $H$ is non-negatively curved.
Therefore for any positive integer $n$ the product $(H,\tfrac1n\cdot h)\times (M,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold with  curvature bounded below by $\kappa$.

The diagonal action of $G$ on $(H,\tfrac1n\cdot h)\times (M,g)$ is        isometric and free. 
Therefore 
the quotient $(H,\tfrac1n\cdot h)\times (M,g)/G$
is a Riemannian manifold, say $(N,g_n)$.
By O'Nail's formula, $(N,g_n)$ has curvature bounded below by $\kappa$.

Clearly, $(N,g_n)$ converge to $(M,g)/G$ as $n\to \infty$.\qeds

This construction is called \index{Cheeger's trick}\emph{Cheeger's trick},
although it was used before Cheeger;
say in \cite{GKM}, it was used to show that Berger's spheres have positive curvature.
This trick is used to construct most of the known examples of positively and non-negatively curved manifolds
 \cite[see][]{cheeger,aloff-wallach,gromoll-meyer,eschenburg-spaces,bazajkin}.
 
The quotient space  $(M,g)/G$ has finite dimension and curvature bounded below in the sense of Alexandrov. 
It is expected that not all spaces with this property admit approximation by Riemannian manifolds with curvature bounded below,
some partial results are discussed in \cite{pwz,kapovitch}.








%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Polar points.}
Fix a unit-speed geodesic $\gamma$ which starts at $p$;
that is, $\gamma(0)=p$.
Set $p^*=\gamma(\pi)$.

Prove that $p^*$ is a solution.\qeds

\parit{Alternative proof.} 
Assume the contrary;
that is, for any $x\in M$ there is a point $x'$ such that 
\[|x-x'|_g+|p-x'|_g>\pi.\]

Show that there is a continuous map $x\mapsto x'$
such that the above inequality holds for any $x$.

Fix sufficiently small $\eps>0$.
Prove that the set $W_\eps=M\backslash B(p,\eps)$ 
is homeomorphic to a ball 
and the map $x\mapsto x'$ sends $W_\eps$ into itself.

By Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, $x=x'$ for some $x$.
In this case 
\begin{align*}
|x-x'|_g+|p-x'|_g&=|p-x'|_g\le
\\
&\le\pi,
\end{align*}
a contradiction.\qeds
 
The problem is due to Anatoliy Milka \cite[see][]{milka-poly}.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Isometric section.}
Arguing by contradiction, 
assume there is an isometric section $\iota\: M\z\to W$.
It makes possible to treat $M$ as a submanifold in $W$.

Given $p\in M$,
denote by $\mathrm{N}^1_p$ the unit normal space to $M$ at $p$.
Given $v\in \mathrm{N}^1_p$ and real value $k$,
set 
\[p^{k\cdot v}=s\circ\exp_{p} (k\cdot v).\]
Note that 
\[p^{0\cdot v}=p\ \ \text{for any}\ \  p\in M\ \ \text{and}\ \ v\in \mathrm{N}^1_p.\leqno({*})\]

Fix sufficiently small $\delta>0$.
By Rauch comparison, 
if $w\in \mathrm{N}^1_q$ 
is the parallel translation of $v\in \mathrm{N}^1_q$ 
along a minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$ in $M$,
then 
\[|p^{k\cdot v}-q^{k\cdot w}|_M<|p-q|_M
\leqno({*}{*})\]
assuming $|k|\le \delta$.
The same comparison implies that 
\[|p^{k\cdot v}-q^{k'\cdot w}|_M^2<|p-q|_M^2+ (k-k')^2
\leqno(\asterism)\]
assuming $|k|,|k'|\le \delta$.

Choose $p$ and $v \in \mathrm{N}^1_p$ so that $r=|p-p^{\delta\cdot v}|$ 
takes the maximal possible value.
From $({*}{*})$ it follows that $r>0$.

Let $\gamma$ be the extension of the unit-speed minimizing geodesic from $p_v$ to $p$;
denote by $v_t$ the parallel translation of $v$ to $\gamma(t)$ along $\gamma$. 

We can choose the parameter of $\gamma$ so that $p=\gamma(0)$, $p^v=\gamma(-r)$.
Set $p_n=\gamma(n\cdot r)$, so $p=p_0$ and $p^v=p_{-1}$. 
Fix large integer $N$ and set $w_n=(1-\tfrac nN)\cdot v_{n\cdot r}$
and $q_n=p_n^{w_n}$.

From $(\asterism)$, there is a constant $C$ independent of $N$ such that
\[|q_k-q_{k+1}|<r+\tfrac C{N^2}\cdot\delta^2.\]
Therefore 
\[|q_{k+1}-p_{k+1}|>|q_k-p_k|-\tfrac C{N^2}\cdot\delta^2.\]
By induction, we get 
\[|q_N-p_N|>r-\tfrac C{N}\cdot\delta^2.\]
Since $N$ is large we get
\[|q_N-p_N|>0.\]
By $({*})$ we get $q_N=p_N^0=p_N$, a contradiction.\qeds


This is the core of the solution of Soul conjecture
by Grigori Perelman \cite[see][]{perelman}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Warped product.}
Given $x\in \Sigma$, denote by $\nu_x$ the normal vector to $\Sigma$ at $x$ which agrees with the orientations of $\Sigma$ and $M$.
Denote by $\kappa_x$ the non-negative principle curvature of $\Sigma$ at $x$;
since $\Sigma$ is minimal the other principle curvature has to be $-\kappa_x$.

Consider the warped product $W=\mathbb S^1\times_f\Sigma$ for some positive smooth function $f\:\Sigma\to \RR$.
Assume that a point $y\in W$ projects to a point $x\in\Sigma$.
Straightforward computations show that
\begin{align*}
\Sc_W(y)
&=\Sc_\Sigma(x)-2\cdot\frac{\Delta f(x)}{f(x)}=
\\
&=\Sc_M(x)-2\cdot\Ric(\nu_x)-2\cdot\kappa_x^2-2\cdot\frac{\Delta f(x)}{f(x)}.
\end{align*}
Consider linear operator $L$ on the space of smooth functions on $\Sigma$ defined as 
\[(Lf)(x)= -[\Ric(\nu_x)+\kappa_x^2]\cdot f(x)-(\Delta f)(x)\]
It is sufficient to find a smooth function $f$ on $\Sigma$ such that
\[f(x)>0 \ \ \text{and}\ \ (Lf)(x)\ge 0\leqno({*})\]
for any $x\in \Sigma$.


Fix a smooth function $f\:\Sigma\to \RR$.
Extend the field $f(x)\cdot\nu_x$
on $\Sigma$ to a smooth field, say $v$, on whole $M$.
Denote by $\iota_t$ the flow along $v$ for time $t$ and set $\Sigma_t=\iota_t(\Sigma)$.

\parit{Informal end of proof.}
Denote by $H_t(x)$ the mean curvature of $\Sigma_t$ at $\iota_t(x)$.
Note that the value $(Lf)(x)$ is the derivative of
the function $t\mapsto H_t(x)$  at $t=0$.

Therefore the condition $({*})$
means that we can push $\Sigma$ into one of its sides 
so that its mean curvature does not increase in the first order.
Since $\Sigma$ is area minimizing,
the existence of such push follows;
read further if you are not convinced.\qeds

\parit{Formal end of proof.}
Denote by $\delta(f)$ the second variation of area of $\Sigma_t$;
that is, consider the area function $a(t)=\area\Sigma_t$ 
and set $\delta(f)=a''(0)$.
Direct calculations show that
\begin{align*}
\delta(f)
&=
\int\limits_{\Sigma} 
\left(-[\Ric(\nu_x)+\kappa_x^2]\cdot f^2(x)+|\nabla f(x)|^2\right)\cdot d_x\area=
\\
&=\int\limits_{\Sigma} 
(Lf)(x)\cdot f(x)\cdot d_x\area.\end{align*}
Since $\Sigma$ is area minimizing we get 
\[\delta(f)\ge 0\leqno({*}{*})\] for any $f$.

Choose a function $f$ which minimize $\delta(f)$ among all the functions such that $\int_\Sigma f^2(x)\cdot d_x\area=1$.
Note that $f$ an eigenfunction 
for the linear operator $L$;
in particular $f$ is smooth.
Denote by $\lambda$ the eigenvalue of $f$;
by $({*}{*})$,
$\lambda\ge 0$.

Show that $f(x)>0$ at any $x$.
Since $Lf=\lambda\cdot f$, the inequalities $({*})$ follow.\qeds


The problem is due to Mikhael Gromov and Blaine Lawson \cite[see][]{gromov-lawson}.
Earlier, Shing-Tung  Yau and Richard Schoen showed that the same assumptions 
imply existence of conformal factor on $\Sigma$ which makes it positively curved.
Both statement are used 
to proof that $\TT^3$ does not admit a metric with positive scalar curvature;
the original proof is given in \cite{schoen-yau}.

Both statements admit straightforward generalization to higher dimensions
and they can be used to show non existence metric with positive scalar curvature on $\TT^m$ with $m\le 7$.
For $m=8$, the proof stops to work 
since in this dimension the area minimizing hypersurfaces might have singularities.
For example, 
any domain in the cone in $\RR^8$
defined by the identity
\[x^2_1+x^2_2+x^2_3+x^2_4=x^2_5+x^2_6+x^2_7+x^2_8\]
is area minimizing among the hypersurfaces with the same boundary.

\parbf{No approximation.}
Fix an increasing function $\phi\:(0,r)\to \RR$
such that 
\[\phi''+(n-1)\cdot(\phi')^2+C=0.\]

Note that if $\Ric_{g_n}\ge C$, 
then the function 
$x\mapsto\phi(|p-x|_{g_n})$ is subharmonic.
Therefore for arbitrary array of points $p_i$ 
and positive reals $\lambda_i$ the function $f_n\:M_n\to \RR$
defined by the formula
$$f(x)=\sum_i\lambda_i\cdot\phi(|p_i-x|_M)$$
is subharmonic.
In particular $f_n$ cannot admit a local minima in $M_n$.

Passing the limit as $n\to \infty$, we get that any function $f\:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}$
of the form 
$$f(x)=\sum_i\lambda_i\cdot\phi(|p_i-x|_{\ell_p})$$
does not admit a local minima in $\mathbb{R}^m$.

Arrive to a contradiction
by showing that if $p\ne 2$,
then there is an array
points $p_i$ and positive reals $\lambda_i$
such that the function 
$$f(x)=\sum_i\lambda_i\cdot\phi(|p_i-x|_{\ell_p})$$
has strict local minimum.\qeds

The argument given here is very close to the proof of Abresch--Gromoll inequality in \cite{abresch-gromoll}.
An alternative solution of this problem can be build on almost splitting theorem proved by  Jeff Cheeger and Tobias Colding in \cite{cheeger-colding}.

\parbf{Area of spheres.}
Fix $r_0>0$.
Given $r>r_0$, choose a point $q$ on the distance $2\cdot r$ from $p$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{30 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0 mm),b(0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/calabi-yau(1)}
\lbl[t]{9.5,8.5;$p$}
\lbl[t]{28,2.5;$q$}
\lbl[b]{10,20.5;$\partial B(p,r)$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that any minimizing geodesic from $q$ to a point in $B(p,r_0)$
has to cross $\partial B(p,r)$.
By volume comparison, we get that 
\[\vol B(p,r_0)\le C_m\cdot r_0\cdot \area \partial B(p,r),\]
where $C_m$ is a constant depending only on the dimension $m=\dim M$;
say, $C_m\z=10^m$ will do.\qeds


Applying the coarea formula, 
we get that volume growth of $M$ 
is at least linear and in particular it has infinite volume.
The latter was proved independently 
by Eugenio Calabi 
and Shing-Tung Yau \cite[see][]{calabi,yau-ricci}.

\parbf{Curvature hollow.}
Construct a metric that the connected sum
$\RR^3\#\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^1$
which is flat outside a compact set and has non positive scalar curvature.
Further, note that such metric can be constructed in such a way that it has a closed geodesic $\gamma$ with trivial holonomy and with constant negative curvature in its a tubular neighborhood.

Let us cut tubular neighborhood $V\simeq\mathbb{D}^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$ of $\gamma$ 
and glue in the product $W\simeq\mathbb{S}^1\times \mathbb{D}^2$ with the swapped factors. 
Note that after this surgery we get back $\RR^3$.

It remains to construct a metric $g$ on $W$ with negative scalar curvature which 
is identical to the original metric on $V$ near its boundary.
The needed space $(W,g)$ can be found among wrap products $\mathbb{S}^1\times_f \mathbb{D}^2$ [see page~\pageref{page:warped product}].
\qeds


This construction was given by Joachim Lohkamp in \cite{lohkamp},
he describes there yet an other equally simple construction.
In fact,
his constructions produce 
$\mathbb{S}^1$-invariant hollows 
with negative Ricci curvature.

On the other hand,
there are no hollows with 
positive scalar curvature and negative sectional curvature.
The former is equivalent to the positive mass conjecture \cite[see][and the references therein]{witten}
and the latter is an easy exercise.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Flat coordinate planes.}
Fix $\eps>0$ such that there is unique geodesic between any two points on distance $<\eps$ from the origin of $\RR^3$.

Consider three points $a$, $b$ and $c$ 
on the coordinate lines which are $\eps$-close 
to the origin.

Prove that the angles of the triangle $[abc]$
coincide with its model angles.
It follows that there is a flat geodesic triangle in $(\RR^3,g)$ with vertex at $a$, $b$ and $c$.

Use the family of constructed flat triangles 
to show that at any $x$ point in the $\tfrac\eps{10}$-neighborhood of the origin
the sectional curvature 
vanish in an open set of sectional directions.
The latter implies that the curvature is identically zero 
in this neighborhood.

Moving the origin and apply the same argument we get that the curvature is identically zero everywhere.

This problem appears in the paper of Dmitri Panov and me \cite[see][]{panov-petrunin}; 
it is based on a lemma discovered by Sergei Buyalo in \cite[Lemma 5.8 in][]{buyalo}.

\parbf{Two-convexity.}
\textit{Morse-style solution.}
Equip $\RR^4$ with coordinates $(x,y,z,t)$.

Consider a generic linear function $\ell\:\RR^4\to\RR$
which is close to the sum of coordinates $x+y+z+t$.
Note that $\ell$
has non-degenerate critical points on $\partial K$ and all its critical values are different.

Consider the sets 
$$W_s=\set{w\in \RR^4\backslash K}{\ell(w)<s}.$$
Note that $W_{-1000}$ contains a closed curve, say $\alpha$, 
which is contactable in $\RR^4\backslash K$, 
but not constructible in the set $W_{-1000}$.

Set $s_0$ to be the infimum of the values $s$ such that
the $\alpha$ is contactable in $W_s$.

Note that $s_0$ is a critical value of $\ell$ on $\partial K$;
denote by $p_0$ the corresponding critical point.
By 2-convexity of $\RR^4\backslash K$,
the index of $p_0$ has to be at most $1$.
On the other hand, since the disc hangs at this point,
its index has to be at least $2$,
 a contradiction.\qeds

\parit{Alexandrov-style proof.}
Fix a constant metric $g$ on $\RR^4$.
According to the main result of Alexander Bishop and Berg in \cite{ABB}, $W_g\z=(\RR^4\backslash (\Int K),g)$ has non-positive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
In particular the universal cover of $\tilde W_g$ of $W_g$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space.

By rescaling $g$ and passing to the limit we obtain that universal Riemannian cover $Z_g$ of $(\RR^4,g)$ branching in the coordinate planes is a $\CAT[0]$ space.
Show that $Z_g$ is $\CAT[0]$ space if and only if the two planes are orthogonal with respect to $g$;
the latter leads to a contradiction.\qeds

The Morse-style proof was essentially given  by Mikhael Gromov in \cite[][\S\textonehalf]{gromov-SGMC}, where two-convexity was introduced.

Note that the $1$-neighborhood of these two planes has two-convex complement $W$ in the sense of the second definition;
that is, if a closed curve $\gamma$ lies in the plane $\Pi$
and contactable in $W$ then it is contactable in $\Pi\cap W$.
Clearly the boundary of this neighborhood is not smooth
and as it follows from above, it cannot be smoothed in the class of two-convex sets. 

Yet an other place where two-convexity shows up --- the zero curvature set in the manifolds of nonnegative or nonpositive curvature is two-convex \cite[see][]{panov-petrunin}.
