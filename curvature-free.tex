\subsection*{Besikovitch inequality}

\begin{pr}{}{Besikovitch inequality}
\label{Besikovitch inequality}
Let $g$ be a Riemannian metric on an $m$-dimensional cube $Q\z=[0,1]^m$ such that any curve connecting opposite faces has length at least $1$. 
Prove that $\vol(Q,g)\ge 1$, 
and equality holds if and only if $(Q,g)$ is isometric to the unit cube.
\end{pr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parit{Semisolution.}
Set 
\[A_i=\set{(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_m)\in[0,1]^m}{x_i=0}.\]

Consider functions $f_i\:[0,1]^m\to\RR$ defined by
$f_i(x)=\dist_{A_i}(x)$.
Note that 
the map $\bm{f}\:([0,1]^m,g)\to\RR^m$
defined as
\[\bm{f}\:x\mapsto(f_1(x),f_2(x),\dots,f_m(x))\]
is Lipschitz.

Prove that Jacobian of  $\bm{f}$
is at most $1$
and $\bm{f}([0,1]^m)\supset [0,1]^m$.
Therefore 
\[\vol(Q,g)\ge \vol([0,1]^m)=1.\]

The equality case is left for the reader.

The inequality was proved by Abram Besikovitch in \cite{besicovitch}.
It has number applications in Riemannian geometry.
For example using this inequality it is easy to solve the following problem.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Assume a metric $g$ on $\RR^m$ coincides with Euclidean outside of a bounded set $K$;
assume further that any geodesic which comes into $K$ goes out from $K$ the same way as if the metric would be Euclidean everywhere. 
Show that $g$ is flat.}

The minimal surface in Riemannian manifolds are defined on page \pageref{minimal surface}.

\begin{pr}{\thm}{Minimal foliation}\label{gromomorphic-curves} 
Consider $\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2$ equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$ 
which is $C^\infty$-close to the product metric. 
Prove that there is a conformally equivalent metric $\lambda\cdot g$ and re-parametrization of $\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2$
such that each sphere $x\times\mathbb{S}^2$ and $\mathbb{S}^2\times y$ forms a minimal surface 
in $(\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2,\lambda\cdot g)$.

\subsection*{Volume and convexity\thm}

A function $f$ defined on Riemannian manifold is called convex if for any geodesic $\gamma$, the composition $f\circ\gamma$ is a convex real-to-real function.

\begin{pr}{\thm}{Volume and convexity}
\label{Volume and convexity} 
Let
$M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold which admits a non-constant
convex function. 
Prove that $M$ has an infinite volume.
\end{pr}

The Liouville's theorem should help to solve this problem;
it states that geodesic flow on the tangent bundle to a Riemannian manifold preserves the volume form.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Sasaki metric}

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold.
The Sasaki metric is the most natural choice of metric on the tangent space $\T M$.
It is uniquely defined by the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The natural projection $\tau\:\T M\to M$ is a Riemannian submersion.
\item The metric on each tangent space $\T_p\subset \T M$ is the Euclidean metric induced by $g$.
\item Assume $\gamma(t)$ is a curve in $M$ and $v(t)\in\T_{\gamma(t)}$ is a parallel vector field along $\gamma$. 
Note that $v(t)$ forms a curve in $\T M$.
For the Sasaki metric, we have the curve $\dot v(t)$ is perpendicular to the fiber $\T_{\gamma(t)}$ for any $t$.
\end{enumerate}

A more constructive way to describe Sasaki metric is given by identifying 
$\T_u[\T M]$ for any $u\in \T_p M$ with the direct sum of so called vertical and horizontal vectors $\T_p M\oplus \T_p M$.
The projection of this splitting defined by the differential of $\tau$
and the Levi-Civita connection.
Then $\T_u[\T M]$ is equipped with the metric  defined as 
\[\hat g(X,Y)=g(X^V,Y^V)+g(X^H,Y^H),\]
where $X^V,X^H\in\T_pM$ denotes the vertical and horizontal components of $X\in\T_u[\T M]$.



\begin{pr}{}{Sasaki metric}\label{pr:Sasaki metric}
Consider the tangent bundle $\T \mathbb{S}^2$ 
equipped with Sasaki metric $\hat g$ induced by a Riemannian metric $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$.

\subsection*{Normal exponential map\easy}

\label{page:Normal exponential map}

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold;
denote by $\T M$ the tangent bundle over $M$ and by $\T_p=\T_pM$ the tangent space at point $p\in M$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Bounded geometry}

Denote by $\mathcal{R}$ the space of 
all Riemannian metrics on $\mathbb S^5$
with absolute value of sectional curvature $\le1$,
and injectivity radius $\ge1$.

It is easy to see that any metric $g_1\in \mathcal{R}$ 
can be connected to the canonical metric $g_0$ on $\mathbb S^5$
by a continuous family of metrics $g_t\in \mathcal{R}$ where $t\in[0,1]$.
In fact, the one parameter family of metrics $g_t$
can be found among the metrics of the type 
\[g_t=a(t)\cdot g_0+b(t)\cdot g_1,\]
where $a,b\:[0,1]\to\RR$
are smooth functions such that $a(0)=1=b(1)$ and $a(1-s)=0=b(s)$ for $s\le \tfrac13$.
In order to keep the bounds on the curvature and injectivity radius,
the functions $a$ and $b$
have to take huge values in the middle of interval.

\begin{pr}{\thm}{Bounded curvature}\label{Bounded curvature}
Fix a fast growing function, say
\[\Phi(x)=1000^{1000\cdot (x+1000)}.\]

Show that there is a metric $g_1$ 
such that 
for any family $g_t$ as above
\[\max_{t\in[0,1]}\{\vol(g_t)\}
>
\Phi(\vol(g_1)).\]
\end{pr}

The expected solution requires Novikov theorem on the algorithmic undecidability of the problem of recognition of the sphere $\mathbb S^m$  for
$m\ge 5$. 
A detailed proof of this theorem can be found in \cite{nabutovsky-NovThm}.

\section*{Semisolutions}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Minimal foliation.}
First show that there is a self-dual harmonic 2-form on $(\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2,g)$;
that is, a 2-form $\omega$ such that $d\omega=0$ and $\star\omega=\omega$,
where $\star$ denotes the Hodge star operator.

Fix $p\in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.
Use the identity $\star\omega_p=\omega_p$
to show that
there is a real number $\lambda_p$ and the isometry $\mathrm{J}_p\:\T_p\to\T_p$ 
such that
$\mathrm{J}_p\circ\mathrm{J}_p =-\id$ 
and 
$\omega(X,Y)=\lambda_p\cdot g(X,\mathrm{J}_pY)$ for any $X,Y\in \T_p$.

Consider the canonical symplectic form $\omega_0$ on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$;
that is, the sum of pullbacks of the volume forms on $\mathbb{S}^2$  
for the two projections $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$.
Note that for the canonical metric on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$,
the form $\omega_0$ is harmonic and self-dual. 
Since $g$ is close to the standard metric,
we can assume that $\omega$ is close to $\omega_0$.
In particular $\lambda_p\ne0$ for any $p\in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.

It follows that $\omega$ defines symplectic structure on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$
and $\mathrm{J}$ is its pseudo-complex structure.
It remains to take the re-parametrization of $\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2$
so that vertical and horizontal spheres will form pseudo-holomorphic curves in the homology classes of $x\times \mathbb{S}^2$ and $\mathbb{S}^2\times y$.
\qeds
 
 
For general metric the form $\omega$ might vanish at some points;
if the metric is generic,
then it happens on disjoint circles \cite[see][]{honda}.







%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Volume and convexity.}
Assume the contrary; that is, there is a complete Riemannian manifold $M$
with finite volume which admits a convex function $f$.

Denote by $\tau\:\UU M\to M$ the unit tangent bundle over $M$. 
Clearly $\vol (\UU M)$ is finite.

Note that 
there is a nonempty bounded open set $\Omega\subset \UU M$
such that $df(u)>\eps$ for any $u\in \Omega$ and some fixed $\eps>0$.

Denote by $\phi^t$ the geodesic flow on $\UU M$.
By Liouville's theorem 
\[\vol[\phi^t(\Omega)]=\vol\Omega\] 
for any $t$.

Given $u\in \Omega$,
consider the function $h\:t\mapsto f\circ\tau\circ\phi^t(u)$.
Note that $h'(t)>\eps$ for any $t\ge 0$.
It follows that there is an infinite sequence of positive reals $t_1,t_2,\dots$
such that 
$$\phi^{t_i}(\Omega)\cap\phi^{t_j}(\Omega)=\emptyset$$ 
if $i\ne j$.
The latter implies that $\vol (\UU M)=\infty$,
a contradiction.
\qeds

The idea in the proof is the same as in 
Poincar\'e recurrence theorem.

The problem is due 
to Richard Bishop and Barrett O'Neill \cite[see][]{bishop-oneill},
it was generalized by
Shing-Tung Yau  in \cite{yau}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Sasaki metric.}
Show that there is a constant $\ell$
such that for any two unit tangent vectors $v\in\T_p\mathbb{S}^2$ 
and $w\in T_q\mathbb{S}^2$
there is a path 
$\gamma\:[0,1]\to\mathbb{S}^2$ from $p$ to $q$
such that 
\[\length \gamma\le \ell\] 
and
$w$ is the parallel transformation of $v$ along $\gamma$.

Note that once it is proved, 
it follows that diameter of the set of all vectors of fixed length in $\T \mathbb{S}^2$ has diameter at most $\ell$;
in particular the map $\T\mathbb{S}^2\to[0,\infty)$ defined as $v\mapsto |v|$ 
preserves the distance with the maximal error $\ell$.
Hence the result follows.

\parbf{Distant involution.}
Given $\eps>0$, construct a disc $\Delta$ in the plane with 
$$\length\partial \Delta<10\ \ \text{and}\ \ \area \Delta<\eps$$
which admits an continuous involution $\iota$ such that 
$$|\iota(x)-x|\ge 1$$ 
for any $x\in\partial \Delta$.
An example of $\Delta$ can be guessed from the picture. 

Take the product $\Delta\times \Delta\subset \RR^4$;
it is homeomorphic to the 4-ball.
Note that 
$$\vol_3[\partial(\Delta\times \Delta)]=2\cdot\area \Delta\cdot\length \partial \Delta<20\cdot\eps.$$
The boundary $\partial(\Delta\times \Delta)$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^3$
and the restriction of the involution $(x,y)\mapsto (\iota(x),\iota(y))$ has the needed property.

It remains to smooth the boundary $\partial(\Delta\times \Delta)$.
\qeds

This example is given by Christopher Croke in \cite{croke}.

It is instructive to show that for $\mathbb{S}^2$ such thing is not possible.

By systolic inequality \cite[see][]{gromov-filling}, 
the involution $\iota$ above cannot be made isometric.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Two-systol.}
Consider the unit cube with three not intersecting cylindrical tunnels  
between the pairs of opposite faces.

In each tunnel, shrink the metric long-wise and expand it  cross-wise while keeping the volume the same.

More precisely, if $(x,y,z)$ is the coordinate system on the cylindrical tunnel $\DD\times [0,1]$ so that $(x,y)$-plane is parallel to the base
then the new metric is 
\[g=\phi\cdot (dx)^2+\phi\cdot (dy)^2+\frac1{\phi^2}\cdot (dz)^2,\]
where $\phi=\phi(x,y)$ is a positive smooth function on $\DD$ which takes huge values around the center and equals to 1 near the boundary of $\DD$.

Gluing the opposite faces of the cube, we obtain a 3-dimensional torus with a smooth Riemannian metric.
It remains to show that for the right choice of function $\phi$, this construction gives the needed example.

I learned this problem from Dmirti Burago. 

 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Normal exponential map.}
Assume the contrary; that is, there is a point $p\in M$ 
such that the image of normal exponential map to $N$
 does not touch $\eps$-neighborhood of $p$.

Show that given $R>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that 
if $x\in N$ and $|p-x|_M<R$, 
then there is a unit speed curve in $N$
which moves to $p$ with velocity at least $\delta$.
(In fact, 
the value $\delta$ depends on $\eps$, $R$ and the curvature bounds in $B(p,R)$.)


Following this curve for sufficient time brings us to $p$;
that is, $p\in N$, a contradiction.
\qeds

The problem was suggested by Alexander Lytchak.

From the picture, you should guess an example of immersion 
such that one point does not lie in the image of the corresponding normal exponential.
It might be interesting to see in more details 
which sets can be avoided by such images.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Symplectic squeezing in the torus.}
The embedding will be given as a composition of a linear symplectomorphism $\lambda$ 
with the quotient map $\phi\:\RR^4\to \TT^2\times\RR^2$ by the integer $(x_1,y_1)$-lattice.
The composition $\phi\circ\lambda$ allways preserves the symplectic structure;
it remains to find $\lambda$ such that the restriction $\phi\circ\lambda|_\Omega$
is injective.

Without loss of generality,
we can assume that $\Omega$ is a ball centered at the origin.
Choose an oriented 2-dimensional subspace $V$ subspace of $\RR^4$ 
such that the integral of $\omega$ over 
$\Omega\cap V$ is small positive number, say $\tfrac\pi4$. 

Note that there is a linear symplectomorphism $\lambda$
 which maps planes parallel to $V$ to planes
parallel to the $(x_1,y_1)$-plane, 
and that maps the disk $V\cap\Omega$ to a disk.
It follows that the intersection of $\lambda(\Omega)$ 
with any plane parallel to the $(x_1,y_1)$-plane is a disk of radius at most $\tfrac 12$.
In particular $\phi\circ\lambda|_\Omega$
is injective.\qeds

This construction is given 
by Larry Guth in \cite{guth-symplectic}
and attributed to Leonid Polterovich.

Note that according to the Gromov's non-squeezing theorem \cite[see][]{gromov-pseudoholomorphic}, 
an analogous statement with $\CC\times \DD$ as the target does not hold, here $\DD\subset \CC$ is the open disc with the induced symplectic structure.
In particular, it shows that
the projection of $\lambda(\Omega)$ as above 
to $(x_1,y_1)$-plane
cannot be made arbitrary small.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Diffeomorphism test.}
Since $N$ is simply connected, 
it is sufficient to show that $f\:M\to N$ is a covering map.

Note that $f$ is an open immersion.
Let $h$ be the pullback metric on $M$ for $f\:M\to N$.
Clearly $h\ge g$.
In particular $(M,h)$ is complete and the map $f\:(M,h)\to N$ is a local isometry. 

It remains to prove that any local isometry between complete connected Riemannian manifolds of the same dimension if a covering map.\qeds

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Volume of tubular neighborhoods.}
Let us denote by $\mathrm{N} M$ and $\T M$ the normal and tangent bundle of $M$ in $\RR^m$.

Consider the normal exponential map $\exp_M\:\mathrm{N} M\to\RR^m$ [defined on page~\pageref{page:Normal exponential map}]
and denote by $J_V$ its Jacobian at $V\in \mathrm{N}_p=\mathrm{N}_pM$.
Note that for all small $r>0$, we have
\[\vol B(M,r)=\int\limits_M d_p\vol_m\cdot\int\limits_{B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_p}}J_V\cdot d_V\vol_{n-m},\leqno{({*})}\]
where $B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_p}$ denotes the ball in $\mathrm{N}_p$

Set $m=\dim M$.
Given $p\in M$, 
denote by $s_p\:\T_p\times \T_p\to \mathrm{N}_p$
the second fundamental form of $M$ [defined on page~\pageref{page:second fundamental form}].
Recall that the curvature tensor of $M$ at $p$ can be expressed the following way
\[R_p(X\wedge Y), V\wedge W\rangle 
=\langle s_p(X,W), s_p(Y,V)\rangle-\langle s_p(X,V), s_p(Y,W)\rangle.\]

Given $V\in \mathrm{N}_p M$,
express $J_V$ in terms of 
$|V|$, 
the dimension $m$
and the real-valued quadratic form  $s_V(X,Y)=\<s_p(X,Y),V\>$.
Show that for small $r$ the integral
\[v(r)=\int\limits_{B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_pM}}J_V\cdot d_V\vol_{n-m}\]
is a polynomial 
of $r$ and its coefficients can be expressed in terms of the curvature tensor $R_p$.

It follows that the right hand side in $({*})$ can be expressed in terms of curvature tensor of $M$.
The problem follows since the curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of metric tensor of $M$.\qeds


The formula for volume of tubular neighborhood 
was given by Hermann Weyl in \cite{weyl}.

\parbf{Disc.}
Show that given a positive integer $n$ one can construct a tree $T$ embedded into the disc such that any homotopy of the boundary of the disc to a point pass through a curve which intersects $n$ different edges.
(For the tree on the diagram $n=3$.)

Fix small $\eps>0$, say $\eps=\tfrac1{10}$.
Consider the disc with embedded tree $T$ as above.
We will construct a metric on the disc 
with diameter and length of its boundary below $1$
such that 
the distance between any two edges of $T$ of without common vertex 
is at least $\eps$.

To construct such a metric, 
fix a metric on the cylinder $\mathbb S^1\times [0,1]$ such that

}

\begin{itemize}
\item The $\eps$-neighborhoods of the boundary components 
have product metrics.
\item Any vertical segment $x\times[0,1]$ has length $\tfrac 12$.
\item One of the boundary component has length $\eps$.
\item The other boundary component has length $2\cdot m\cdot \eps$, 
where $m$ is the number of edges in the tree $T$.
\end{itemize}
Equip $T$ with a length-metric so that each edge has length $\eps$
and glue the long boundary component of the cylinder to $T$ by piecewise isometry so that the resulting space is homeomorphic to disc and the tree corresponds to it-self.



According to the first construction,
for any null-homotopy of the boundary 
the least length is at least $n\cdot\tfrac{\eps}{10}$.
The obtained metric is not Riemannian, but is easy to smooth.
Since $n$ is arbitrary the result follows.

formed by the concatenation of $\gamma|_{[0,t_0]}$ and $\sigma$.
Applying a curve shortening process to $\lambda_0$, 
we get a  homotopy $\lambda_t$
rel. its ends 
from the loop $\lambda_0$ to a geodesic loop $\lambda_1$ at $p$.
From above, 
\[\length\lambda_1\le L-D.\]

The concatenation $\gamma_t=\lambda_t*\bar\sigma*\gamma|_{[t_0,1]}$
is a homotopy
from $\gamma_0'$ to an other curve $\gamma_1$.
From the construction it is clear that 
\begin{align*}
 \length \gamma_t&\le \length \gamma_0+2\cdot \length\sigma\le
 \\
 &\le \length \gamma_0+2\cdot D
\end{align*}
for any $t\in[0,1]$
and 
\begin{align*}
 \length \gamma_1&=\length\lambda_1+\length\sigma+\length\gamma|_{[t_0,1]}\le
\\ &\le L-D+D+\length\gamma-(L+\delta)=
\\ &=\ell_0 -\delta.
\end{align*}
Repeating the procedure few times we get we get curves $\gamma_2$, $\gamma_3,\dots,\gamma_n$
connected by the needed homotopies so that 
$\ell_{i+1}\le\ell_i-\delta$ and $\ell_n< L+\delta$,
where $\ell_i=\length\gamma_i$.

If $\ell_n\le L$, we are done.
Otherwise repeat the argument once more for $\delta'=\ell_n-L$.

The problem is due to 
Alexander Nabutovsky 
and Regina Rotman \cite[see][]{nabutovsky-rotman}.

It is not at all easy to find an example of a manifold  which satisfy the above condition for some $L$;
they are found among the Zoll spheres
by Florent Balachev, Christopher Croke and Mikhail Katz \cite[see][]{balacheff-croke-katz}.

\parbf{Convex hypersurface.}
Let us define the cone construction.
Let $\Delta$ be a simplex and $\Delta_v$ facet of $\Delta$ opposite to the vertex $v$.
Assume $f_v\:\Delta_v\to M$ is a map and $x\in M$ such that $f_v(\Delta_v)\subset B(x,1)$.
Given $w\in \Delta_v$ denote by $\gamma_w$ the (necessary unique) minimizing geodesic path from $x$ to  $f_v(w)$.
Then the map $f\:\Delta\to M$ defined as 
\[f\:(1-t)\cdot v+t\cdot w\mapsto \gamma_w(t)\] 
is called \index{cone over map}\emph{cone over $f_v$} with vertex $x$. 

Let $h$ be the maximal distance from points in $W$ to $M$.

Fix a fine triangulation of $W$ 
so that $M$ becomes a sub-complex.
Say, let us assume that the diameter of each simplex in $\tau$ is less than 
$\eps$.
We can assume that $\tau$ is a barycentric subdivision of an other triangulation, so all the vertices of $\tau$ can be colored into colors $(0,\dots, m+1)$
in such a way that the vertices of each simplex 
get different colors.
Denote by $\tau_i$ the maximal $i$-dimensional sub-complex of $\tau$ 
with all the vertices colored by $0,\dots, i$.

For each vertex $v$ in $\tau$ 
choose a point $v'\in M$ on the distance $\le h$.
Note that 
if $v$ and $w$ are the vertices of one simplex,
then
\[|v'-w'|_M<2\cdot h+\eps.\]

If $\tfrac{1}{2\cdot(m+1)}>h$, fix $\eps<\tfrac{1}{2\cdot(m+1)}-h$.
Let us extend the map $v\mapsto v'$ 
to a continuous 
map $W\to M$.
The map is already defined on $\tau_0$.
Using the cone construction we can extend it to $\tau_1$;
we can do this since the distance between vertices in one simplex are below injectivity radius of $M$.
Repeat the cone construction recursively, to extend the map to $\tau_2,\dots,\tau_{m+1}=\tau$;
the distance estimates are needed in this construction.

It follows that fundamental class of $M$ vanish in the homology ring of $M$, 
a contradiction.

This problem is a stripped version of the bound on filling radius given by Mikhael Gromov in \cite{gromov-filling}.

\parbf{Almost constant function.}
Given a positive integer $m$,
denote by $\delta_m$ 
the expected value $|x_1|$ of a unit vector 
$\bm{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_m)\z\in\RR^m$ 
with respect to the uniform distribution.

Observe that $\delta_m\to 0$ as $m\to\infty$.

Equip the unit tangent bundle $\UU M$ of $M$ with the natural probability measure.
Since $f$ is $1$-Lipschitz,
for a random vector $v$ in $\UU M$,
the  expected value of $|df(w)|$
is at most $\delta_m$.

Note that 
\begin{align*}
|f\circ \gamma(1)-f\circ\gamma(0)|
&=
\left|\int\limits_0^1df(\dot\gamma(t))\cdot dt\right|\le \\
&\le \int\limits_0^1\left|df(\dot\gamma(t))\right|\cdot dt.
\end{align*}

Assume $\dot\gamma(0)$
takes random value in $\UU M$.
By Liouville's theorem, the same holds for $\dot\gamma(t)$
for any fixed $t$.
Therefore
the expected value of
\[\int\limits_0^1|df(\dot\gamma(t))|\cdot dt\]
is at most $\delta_m$.

By Markov's inequality,
the probability of the event 
\[|f\circ \gamma(1)-f\circ\gamma(0)|>\eps\]
is at most $\tfrac{\delta_m}{\eps}$.
Hence the result follows.

I learned the problem from Mikhael Gromov.
It gives an example in the Riemannian world
of so called 
\index{concentration of measure}\emph{concentration of measure phenomenon}
\cite[see][]{milman-schechtman}.

\parbf{Bounded geometry.}
Show that there is an algorithm to estimate the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between two Riemannian manifolds given in any reasonable way.

Show that if two manifolds with bounded curvature are sufficiently close to each other then they are diffeomorphic.

Now assume contrary;
that is, for any metric $g_1\in \mathcal{R}$ there is a path $g_t$ in $\mathcal{R}$
connecting the canonical metric $g_0$ to $g_1$ such that 
\[\vol g_t\le \Phi(\vol g_1).\]

If a 5-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with curvature between $\pm1$ is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^5$ 
then it can be described by a metric $g_1$ in $\mathcal{R}$.
Let $g_t$ be the path as above.

Construct a finite set $F\subset \mathcal{R}$ 
which is sufficiently dense in the set of metrics in $\mathcal{R}$ with volume at most $\Phi(\vol g_1)$.
The path $g_t$ as above can be approximated by a sequence of metrics from $F$.

Using the algorithms above one can list all such sequences.
It implies existence of algorithm 
which recognize $\mathbb S^5$ among $5$-dimensional manifolds.
The later contradicts Novikov theorem.

Instead of function $\Phi$ one can take any Turing computable function.
The problem and number of its generalizations 
are due to Alexander Nabutovsky \cite[see][]{nabutovsky-Disconnectedness}.
