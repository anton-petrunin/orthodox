\subsection*{Distant involution}

\begin{pr}{}{Distant involution}\label{Distant involution}
Construct a Riemannian metric $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^3$ and an involution $\iota\:\mathbb{S}^3\z\to\mathbb{S}^3$ such that $\vol (\mathbb{S}^3,g)$ is arbitrary small and 
\[|x\z-\iota(x)|_g>1\]
 for any $x\in\mathbb{S}^3$.
\end{pr}

\parit{Semisolution.}
Given $\eps>0$, construct a disc $\Delta$ in the plane with 
$$\length\partial \Delta<10\ \ \text{and}\ \ \area \Delta<\eps$$
which admits an continuous involution $\iota$ such that 
$$|\iota(x)-x|\ge 1$$ 
for any $x\in\partial \Delta$.
An example of $\Delta$ can be guessed from the picture. 

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{31 mm}

\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Take the product $\Delta\times \Delta\subset \RR^4$;
it is homeomorphic to the 4-ball.
Note that 
$$\vol_3[\partial(\Delta\times \Delta)]=2\cdot\area \Delta\cdot\length \partial \Delta<20\cdot\eps.$$
The boundary $\partial(\Delta\times \Delta)$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^3$
and the restriction of the involution $(x,y)\z\mapsto (\iota(x),\iota(y))$ has the needed property.

It remains to smooth $\partial(\Delta\times \Delta)$ slightly.

This example is given by Christopher Croke in \cite{croke}.

It is instructive to show that for $\mathbb{S}^2$ such thing is not possible.
Note also, that according to Gromov's systolic inequality \cite[see][]{gromov-filling}, 
the involution $\iota$ above cannot be made isometric.

\subsection*{Volume and convexity\thm}

A function $f$ defined on Riemannian manifold is called convex if for any geodesic $\gamma$, the composition $f\circ\gamma$ is a convex real-to-real function.

\begin{pr}{\thm}{Volume and convexity}
\label{Volume and convexity} 
Let
$M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold which admits a non-constant
convex function. 
Prove that $M$ has an infinite volume.
\end{pr}

The expected solution use Liouville's theorem on phase volume.
It implies in particular, that geodesic flow on the tangent bundle to a Riemannian manifold preserves the volume form.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Sasaki metric}

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold.
The Sasaki metric is the most natural choice of Riemannian metric $\hat g$ on the total space of the tangent bundle $\tau\:\T M\to M$.
It is uniquely defined by the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item The map $\tau\:(\T M,\hat g)\to (M,g)$ is a Riemannian submersion.
\item The metric on each tangent space $\T_p\subset \T M$ is the Euclidean metric induced by $g$.
\item Assume $\gamma(t)$ is a curve in $M$ and $v(t)\in\T_{\gamma(t)}$ is a parallel vector field along $\gamma$. 
Note that $v(t)$ forms a curve in $\T M$.
For the Sasaki metric, we have $v'(t)\perp \T_{\gamma(t)}$ for any $t$;
that is, the curve $v(t)$ normally crosses the tangent spaces $\T_{\gamma(t)}\subset \T M$.
\end{enumerate}

In other words, we identify the tangent space 
$\T_u[\T M]$ for any $u\in \T_p M$ with the direct sum of so called vertical and horizontal vectors $\T_p M\oplus \T_p M$.
The projection of this splitting defined by the differential $d\tau\:\T\T M\to \T M$
and we assume that a the velocity of a curve in $\T M$ formed by parallel field along a curve in $M$ is horizontal.
Then $\T_u[\T M]$ is equipped with the metric $\hat g$ defined as 
\[\hat g(X,Y)=g(X^V,Y^V)+g(X^H,Y^H),\]
where $X^V,X^H\in\T_pM$ denotes the vertical and horizontal components of $X\in\T_u[\T M]$.



\begin{pr}{}{Sasaki metric}\label{pr:Sasaki metric}
Consider the tangent bundle $\T \mathbb{S}^2$ 
equipped with Sasaki metric $\hat g$ induced by a Riemannian metric $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^2$.
Show that, in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff,
the space $(\T \mathbb{S}^2, \hat g)$ lies on bounded distance to the ray $\RR_+=[0,\infty)$.
\end{pr}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Two-systole}

\begin{pr}{} Given a big real number $L$,
construct a Riemannian metric $g$ on the 3-dimensional torus $\TT^3$ such that $\vol(\TT^3,g)=1$
and \[\area S\ge L\]
for any closed surface $S$ which does not bound in $\TT^3$.
\end{pr}

According to Gromov's systolic inequality \cite[see][]{gromov-filling}, the volume of $(\TT^3,g)$ can be bounded below in terms of its \emph{1-systole} defined to be the least length of a noncontractible loop in $(\TT^3,g)$.
The lower bound on area of $S$ as in the problem is called 2-systole of $(\TT^3,g)$.
Therefore the problem states that the systolic inequality does not have a direct 2-dimensional analog.

such that $\gamma(0)=p$ and $\gamma'(0)=v$.

\subsection*{Almost constant function}

The unit tangent bundle $\UU M$ over a closed Riemannian manifold $M$
admits a natural choice of volume.
Let us equip $\UU M$ with the probability measure which is proportional to the volume.

We say that a unit-speed geodesic $\gamma\:\RR\to M$ is \emph{random}
if $\gamma'(0)$ takes the random value in $\UU M$.

For a random unit-speed geodesic $\gamma$ in $M$ 
the event 
\[|f\circ\gamma(0)-f\circ\gamma(1)|>\eps\]
happens with probability at most $\eps$.
\end{pr}



\section*{Semisolutions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Besikovitch inequality.}
Without loss of generality, we may assume  $Q=[0,1]^m$.
Set 
\[A_i=\set{(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_m)\in[0,1]^m}{x_i=0}.\]

Consider functions $f_i\:[0,1]^m\to\RR$ defined as
$$f_i(x)=\max\{1,\dist_{A_i}(x)\}$$
Note that each $f_i$ is $1$-Lipschitz, 
in particular $|\nabla f|\le 1$ almost everywhere.

Consider the map
\[\bm{f}\:x\mapsto(f_1(x),f_2(x),\dots,f_m(x)).\]
Notes that it maps $Q$ to it self
and, moreover, it maps each face of $Q$ to it self.
It follows that the restriction $\bm{f}|_{\partial Q}\:\partial Q\to \partial Q$ has degree 1 and therefore 
$\bm{f}\:Q\to Q$ is onto.

Assume $h$ is the canonical metric on the cube $Q$.
Then 
\[|\mathrm{J}(x)|=|\nabla_x f_1\wedge\dots\wedge\nabla_xf_m|\le 1,\]
where $\mathrm{J}(x)$ denotes the Jcaobian of the map $f\:(Q,g)\to (Q,h)$.

By the area formula, we get 
\begin{align*}
\vol(Q,g)
&\ge \int\limits_Q\frac1{|\mathrm{J}(x)|}\cdot d_x\vol_g\ge
\\
&\ge\vol(Q,h)=\\
&=1
\end{align*}

In the case of equality we have that $\<\nabla_x f_i,\nabla_x f_j\>=0$ for $i\ne j$ are 
and $|\nabla_x f_i|=1$ almost everywhere.
It follows then that the map $f\:(Q,g)\to (Q,h)$ is an isometry.
\qeds

The inequality was proved by Abram Besikovitch in \cite{besicovitch}.
It has number applications in Riemannian geometry.
For example using this inequality it is easy to solve the following problem.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Assume a metric $g$ on $\RR^m$ coincides with Euclidean outside of a bounded set $K$;
assume further that any geodesic which comes into $K$ goes out from $K$ the same way as if the metric would be Euclidean everywhere. 
Show that $g$ is flat.}
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Minimal foliation.}
The proof is based on the observation that a self-dual harmonic 2-form on $(\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2,g)$
defines a symplectic structure compatible with $g$.

\medskip

Note that there is a self-dual harmonic 2-form on $(\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2,g)$;
that is, a 2-form $\omega$ such that $d\omega=0$ and $\star\omega=\omega$,
where $\star$ denotes the Hodge star operator.
Indeed, fix a generic harmonic form $\phi$;
the form $\star\phi$ is also harmonic.
Since $\star\star\phi=\phi$,
the form $\omega=\phi+\star\phi$ does the trick.

Fix $p\in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.
We can use $g_p$ to identify tangent space $\T_p$ and the cotangent space $\T^*_p$.
We can choose an $g_p$-orthonormal basis $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4$ on $\T_p$ so that 
\[\omega_p=\lambda_p\cdot e_1\wedge e_2+\lambda'_p\cdot  e_3\wedge e_4\]
Since $\star\omega_p=\omega_p$, we have $\lambda_p=\lambda'_p$.
Consider the rotation $\mathrm{J}_p\:\T_p\to\T_p$ defined by 
\[ 
e_1\mapsto e_2,
\quad 
e_2\mapsto -e_1,
\quad 
e_3\mapsto e_4,
\quad 
e_4\mapsto-e_3.\]
Note that
\[\mathrm{J}_p\circ\mathrm{J}_p =-\id
\quad\text{and}\quad
\omega(X,Y)=\lambda_p\cdot g(X,\mathrm{J}_pY)\] 
for any two tangent vectors $X,Y\in \T_p$.

Consider the canonical symplectic form $\omega_0$ on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$;
that is, the sum of pullbacks of the volume forms on $\mathbb{S}^2$  
for the two projections $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$.
Note that for the canonical metric on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$,
the form $\omega_0$ is harmonic and self-dual. 
Since $g$ is close to the standard metric,
we can assume that $\omega$ is close to $\omega_0$.
In particular $\lambda_p\ne0$ for any $p\in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.

It follows that $\mathrm{J}$ is a pseudo-complex structure for the symplectic form $\omega$ on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.
Further the Riemannian metric $g'=\lambda\cdot g$ is a  conformal to $g$ and $\omega(X,Y)=g'(X,\mathrm{J} Y)$ 
for any two tangent vectors $X,Y$ at one point.
Recall that in this case the $\mathrm{J}$-holomorphic curves are minimal with respect to $g'$;
in fact, they are area minimizing in its homology class. 

Take a re-parametrization of $\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2$
so that vertical and horizontal spheres will form pseudo-holomorphic curves in the homology classes of $x\times \mathbb{S}^2$ and $\mathbb{S}^2\times y$.
Hence the statement follows.
\qeds
 
 
For general metric the form $\omega$ might vanish at some points.
If the metric is generic, then it happens on disjoint circles \cite[see][]{honda}.







%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Volume and convexity.}
We use the idea from the proof of Poincar\'e recurrence theorem.

\medskip

Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold which admits a convex function $f$.
Denote by $\tau\:\UU M\to M$ the unit tangent bundle over $M$. 
Consider the function $F\:\UU M\to \RR$ defined as $F(u)=f\circ\tau(u)$.

Note that 
there is a nonempty bounded open set $\Omega\subset \UU M$
such that $df(u)>\eps$ for any $u\in \Omega$ and some fixed $\eps>0$.

Denote by $\phi^t$ the geodesic flow for time $t$ on $\UU M$.
By Liouville's theorem on phase volume, we have
\[\vol[\phi^t(\Omega)]=\vol\Omega\leqno{({*})}\] 
for any $t$.

Given $u\in \Omega$,
consider the function 
$h_u(t)=F\circ\phi^t(u)$.
Since $f$ is convex, we have $h'_u(t)>\eps$ for any $t\ge 0$.

It follows that there is an infinite sequence of times 
\[0=t_0<t_1\z<t_2<\dots\]
such that 
\[h_v(t_{i-1})<h_u(t_{i})\]
for any $u,v\in \Omega$ and $i$.
In particular, we have
$$\phi^{t_i}(\Omega)\cap\phi^{t_j}(\Omega)=\emptyset$$ 
if $i\ne j$.
By $({*})$, the latter implies that $\vol (\UU M)=\infty$.
Hence \[\vol M=\infty.\]

The problem is due 
to Richard Bishop and Barrett O'Neill \cite[see][]{bishop-oneill},
it was generalized by
Shing-Tung Yau  in \cite{yau}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Sasaki metric.}
Fix a point $p\in\mathbb{S}^2$.
Note that any rotation of the tangent space $\T_p=\T_p(\mathbb{S}^2,g)$
appear as a holonomy of some loop at $p$;
moreover the length of such loop can be bounded by some constant, say $\ell$.

Indeed, fix a smooth homotopy $\gamma_t\:[0,1]\to \mathbb{S}^2$, $t\in[0,1]$ of loops based at $p$ 
which sweeps out $\mathbb{S}^2$.
By Gauss--Bonnet formula, the total curvature of $(\mathbb{S}^2,g)$ is $4\cdot\pi$.
It follows that any rotation of $\T_p$ appears as a holonomy of $\gamma_t$ for some $t$.
Therefore one can take 
\[\ell=\max\set{\length\gamma_t}{t\in[0,1]}.\]

Denote by $d$ the diameter of $(\mathbb{S}^2,g)$.
From above it follows that for any two unit tangent vectors $v\in\T_p$ 
and $w\in T_q$
there is a path 
$\gamma\:[0,1]\to\mathbb{S}^2$ from $p$ to $q$
such that 
\[\length \gamma\le \ell+d\] 
and
$w$ is the parallel transformation of $v$ along $\gamma$.

In particular, the diameter of the set of all vectors of fixed length in $(\T \mathbb{S}^2,\hat g)$ has diameter at most $\ell+d$.
Therefore the map $\T\mathbb{S}^2\to[0,\infty)$ defined as $v\mapsto |v|$ 
preserves the distance with the maximal error $\ell+d$.
Hence the result follows.

\parbf{Two-systole.}
Consider the unit cube with three not intersecting cylindrical tunnels  
between the pairs of opposite faces.

In each tunnel, shrink the metric long-wise and expand it  cross-wise while keeping the volume the same.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{29 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/tunnels}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

More precisely, assume $(x,y,z)$ is the coordinate system on the cylindrical tunnel $\DD\times [0,1]$ 
then the new metric is 
\[g=\phi\cdot [(dx)^2+ (dy)^2]+\frac1{\phi^2}\cdot (dz)^2,\]
where $\phi=\phi(x,y)$ is a positive smooth function on $\DD$ which takes huge values around the center and equals to 1 near the boundary of $\DD$.


Gluing the opposite faces of the cube, we obtain a 3-dimensional torus with a smooth Riemannian metric.

Since the surface $S$ does not bound in $\TT^3=\mathbb{S}^1\times\mathbb{S}^1\times\mathbb{S}^1$,
one of the three coordinates projections $\TT^3\to\TT^2=\mathbb{S}^1\times\mathbb{S}^1$
induce a map of non-zero degree $S\to\TT^2$.
It follows that 
\[\area S\ge  \area(\DD,\phi\cdot [(dx)^2+ (dy)^2]).\]
Clearly for the right choice of function $\phi$, the right hand side can be taken bigger than the given number $L$.
Hence the statement follows.
\qeds

I learned this problem from Dmirti Burago. 

 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Normal exponential map.}
Assume the contrary; that is, there is a point $p\in M$ 
such that the image of normal exponential map to $L$
 does not intersect the ball $B(p,\eps)_M$; that is, no geodesic normal to $L$ crosses $B(p,\eps)_M$.

Fix a positive real number $R$ such that $B(p,R)_M\cap L\ne \emptyset$.
The sectional curvature of $M$ in the ball $B(p,R)$
is bounded above by some constant, say $K$.

Given $q\in L$, denote by $v_q$ the direction of a minimizing geodesic $[qp]$.
Note that $v_q\notin \mathrm{N}_qL$.
Moreover there is $\delta=\delta(\eps,K,R)>0$ 
such that for any point $q\in B(p,R)_M\cap L$,
and any normal vector $u\in \mathrm{N}_qL$,
we have 
\[\measuredangle (v_q,u)>\delta.\]
Otherwise the geodesic in the direction of $u$ would cross $B(p,\eps)_M$.

It follows that starting at any point $q\in B(p,R)_M\cap L$ 
one can construct a unit-speed curve in $L$
which moves to $p$ with velocity at least $\sin\delta$.
Following this curve for sufficient time brings us to $p$;
that is, $p\in L$, a contradiction.

From the picture, you should guess an example of immersion

It might be interesting to understand what type of subsets can be avoided by such images.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Symplectic squeezing in the torus.}
The embedding will be given as a composition of a linear symplectomorphism $\lambda$ 
with the quotient map $\phi\:\RR^4\to \TT^2\times\RR^2$ by the integer $(x_1,y_1)$-lattice.
The composition $\phi\circ\lambda$ always preserves the symplectic structure;
it remains to find $\lambda$ such that the restriction $\phi\circ\lambda|_\Omega$
is injective.

Without loss of generality,
we can assume that $\Omega$ is a ball centered at the origin.
Choose an oriented 2-dimensional subspace $V$ subspace of $\RR^4$ 
such that the integral of $\omega$ over 
$\Omega\cap V$ is a small positive number, say $\tfrac\pi4$. 

Note that there is a linear symplectomorphism $\lambda$
 which maps planes parallel to $V$ to planes
parallel to the $(x_1,y_1)$-plane, 
and that maps the disk $V\cap\Omega$ to a disk.
It follows that the intersection of $\lambda(\Omega)$ 
with any plane parallel to the $(x_1,y_1)$-plane is a disk of radius at most $\tfrac 12$.
In particular $\phi\circ\lambda|_\Omega$
is injective.\qeds

This construction is given 
by Larry Guth in \cite{guth-symplectic}
and attributed to Leonid Polterovich.

Note that according to the Gromov's non-squeezing theorem \cite[see][]{gromov-pseudoholomorphic}, 
an analogous statement with $\CC\times \DD$ as the target does not hold, here $\DD\subset \CC$ is the open disc with the induced symplectic structure.
In particular, it shows that
the projection of $\lambda(\Omega)$ as above 
to $(x_1,y_1)$-plane
cannot be made arbitrary small.

\parbf{Diffeomorphism test.}
Since $N$ is simply connected,

Note that $f$ is an open immersion.
Let $h$ be the pullback metric on $M$ for $f\:M\to N$.
Clearly $h\ge g$.
In particular $(M,h)$ is complete and the map $f\:(M,h)\to N$ is a local isometry. 

Note that any local isometry between complete connected Riemannian manifolds of the same dimension if a covering map.

The proof of the claim can be done by induction on $n$; the base is trivial.
Assuming we constructed $T_{n-1}$, the tree $T_n$ can be obtained by identifying three endpoints of three copies of $T_{n-1}$.

Fix $\eps=\tfrac1{10}$ and a large integer $n$.
Let us construct a metric on the disc $\DD$ with the embedded tree $T_n$ as in $({*})$ such that
its diameter and length of its boundary below $1$
and  
the distance between any two edges of $T_n$ of without common vertex 
is at least $\eps$.



Fix a metric on the cylinder $\mathbb S^1\times [0,1]$ such that


\begin{itemize}
\item The $\eps$-neighborhoods of the boundary components 
have product metrics.
\item Any vertical segment $x\times[0,1]$ has length $\tfrac 12$.
\item One of the boundary component has length $\eps$.
\item The other boundary component has length $2\cdot m\cdot \eps$, 
where $m$ is the number of edges in the tree $T_n$.
\end{itemize}
Equip $T_n$ with a length-metric so that each edge has length $\eps$.
Glue the long boundary component of the cylinder to $T_n$ by piecewise isometry 
in such a way that the resulting space is homeomorphic to disc and the obtained embedding of $T_n$ in $\DD$ is the same as in the claim $({*})$.


By $({*})$ and the construction, for any null-homotopy of the boundary 
the least length exceeds $\tfrac{\eps}{10}\cdot n=\tfrac{1}{100}\cdot n$.
The obtained metric is not Riemannian, but is easy to smooth while keeping this property.

Since $n$ is large the result follows.

\parbf{Shortening homotopy.}
Set 
\[p=\gamma_0(0)\ \ \text{and}\ \  \ell_0=\length\gamma_0.\]

By compactness argument,
there exists $\delta>0$ 
such that no geodesic loops based at $p$ with has length in the interval $(L-D, L+D+\delta]$. 

Assume $\ell_0\ge L+\delta$.
Choose $t_0\in [0,1]$ such that
\[\length\left(\gamma_0|_{[0,t_0]}\right)=L+\delta\]
Let $\sigma$ be a minimizing geodesic from $\gamma(t_0)$
to $p$.
Note that $\gamma_0$ is homotopic to the concatenation 
\[\gamma_0'=\gamma_0|_{[0,t_0]}*\sigma*\bar\sigma*\gamma|_{[t_0,1]},\]
where $\bar\sigma$ denotes the backward parametrization of $\sigma$.

\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Consider the loop $\lambda_0$ at $p$
formed by the concatenation of $\gamma|_{[0,t_0]}$ and $\sigma$.
Applying a curve shortening process to $\lambda_0$, 
we get a  homotopy $\lambda_t$
rel. its ends 
from the loop $\lambda_0$ to a geodesic loop $\lambda_1$ at $p$.
From above, 
\[\length\lambda_1\le L-D.\]

The concatenation $\gamma_t=\lambda_t*\bar\sigma*\gamma|_{[t_0,1]}$
is a homotopy
from $\gamma_0'$ to an other curve $\gamma_1$.
From the construction it is clear that 
\begin{align*}
 \length \gamma_t&\le \length \gamma_0+2\cdot \length\sigma\le
 \\
 &\le \length \gamma_0+2\cdot D
\end{align*}
for any $t\in[0,1]$
and 
\begin{align*}
 \length \gamma_1&=\length\lambda_1+\length\sigma+\length\gamma|_{[t_0,1]}\le
\\ &\le L-D+D+\length\gamma-(L+\delta)=
\\ &=\ell_0 -\delta.
\end{align*}
Repeating the procedure few times we get we get curves $\gamma_2$, $\gamma_3,\dots,\gamma_n$
connected by the needed homotopies so that 
$\ell_{i+1}\le\ell_i-\delta$ and $\ell_n< L+\delta$,
where $\ell_i=\length\gamma_i$.

If $\ell_n\le L$, we are done.
Otherwise repeat the argument once more for $\delta'=\ell_n-L$.

The problem is due to 
Alexander Nabutovsky 
and Regina Rotman \cite[see][]{nabutovsky-rotman}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Convex hypersurface.}
First let us define the {}\emph{cone construction} of maps into $M$.

Assume $\Delta'$ be a simplex and $\Delta$ is its facet opposite to the vertex $v$.
Assume $f\:\Delta\to M$ is a map and $x\in M$ such that $f(\Delta)\subset B(x,1)$.
Given $w\in \Delta$ denote by $\gamma_w$ the minimizing geodesic path from $x$ to  $f(w)$.
(Since the injectivity radius of $M$ is at least $1$, the geodesic $\gamma_w$ is uniquely defined.)
Then the map $f'\:\Delta'\to M$ defined as 
\[f'\:(1-t)\cdot v+t\cdot w\mapsto \gamma_w(t)\] 
is called {}\emph{cone over $f$} with the vertex $x$. 

One may start with a map $f_0\:\Delta_0\to M$ and iterate the cone construction for the vertices $x_1,\dots x_k$,
to get a sequence of maps $f_i\:\Delta_i\to M$
as far as $f_{i-1}(\Delta_{i-1})\subset B(x_i,1)$.
Straightforward application of triangle inequality 
shows that the latter conditions hold if 
$f_0(\Delta_0)\subset B(x_i,s)$ for each $i$ and $s<\tfrac2{2+k}$.

\medskip

Now we coming back to the solution of the problem.

Fix a fine triangulation of $W$ so that $M$ becomes a sub-complex of $W$.
We can assume that the diameter of each simplex in $\tau$ is less than any given
$\eps>0$.
Further, we can assume that all the vertices of $\tau$ can be colored into colors $(0,\dots, m+1)$
in such a way that the vertices of each simplex 
get different colors;
the latter can be acheaved by passing to the barycentric subdivision of $\tau$.
Denote by $\tau_i$ the maximal $i$-dimensional sub-complex of $\tau$ 
with all the vertices colored by $0,\dots, i$.

Let $h$ be the maximal distance from points in $W$ to $M$.
For each vertex $v$ in $\tau$ 
choose a point $v'\in M$ on the distance $\le h$.
Note that 
if $v$ and $w$ are the vertices of one simplex,
then
\[|v'-w'|_M<2\cdot h+\eps.\]

Assume $\tfrac{2}{m+3}>h$.
Let us apply the iterated cone construction described above construction for $\eps<\tfrac{2}{m+3}-h$ to get an extention of the map $v\mapsto v'$ 
to a continuous 
map $W\to M$.
The map is already defined on $\tau_0$.
Using the cone construction we can extend it to $\tau_1$;
we can do this since the distance between vertices in one simplex are below injectivity radius of $M$.
Repeat the cone construction recursively, to extend the map to $\tau_2,\dots,\tau_{m+1}=\tau$.
According to the estimates above the cone constructions are well defiend at each of the $m+1$ iterations.

It follows that fundamental class of $M$ vanish in the homology ring of $M$, 
a contradiction.

This problem is a stripped version of the bound on filling radius given by Mikhael Gromov in \cite{gromov-filling}.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Almost constant function.}
Given a positive integer $m$,
denote by $\delta_m$ 
the expected value of $|x_1|$ for the random unit vector 
$\bm{x}\z=(x_1,\dots,x_m)\z\in\RR^m$ 
with respect to the uniform distribution.

Observe that $\delta_m\to 0$ as $m\to\infty$.
Indeed, from symmetry and Bunyakovsky inequality we get
\[
\tfrac1m=\tfrac1m\cdot\mathrm{E}(|\bm{x}|^2)
=\mathrm{E}(x_1^2)\ge \mathrm{E}(|x_1|)^2=\delta_m^2.
\]

Since $f$ is $1$-Lipschitz,
\[\mathrm{E}(|df(w)|)\le\delta_m\]
for a random vector $w$ in $\UU M$.


Note that 
\begin{align*}
|f\circ \gamma(1)-f\circ\gamma(0)|
&=
\left|\int\limits_0^1df(\gamma'(t))\cdot dt\right|\le \\
&\le \int\limits_0^1\left|df(\gamma'(t))\right|\cdot dt.
\end{align*}

Assume $\gamma'(0)$
takes random value in $\UU M$.
By Liouville's theorem on phase volume, the same holds for $\gamma'(t)$
for any fixed $t$.
Therefore
the expected value of
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{E}(|f\circ \gamma(1)-f\circ\gamma(0)|)\le \mathrm{E}\left(\int\limits_0^1|df(\gamma'(t))|\cdot dt\right)\le\delta_m.
\end{align*}

By Markov's inequality,
the probability of the event 
\[|f\circ \gamma(1)-f\circ\gamma(0)|>\eps\]
is at most $\tfrac{\delta_m}{\eps}$.
Hence the result follows.

I learned the problem from Mikhael Gromov.
It gives an example in the Riemannian world
of the so called 
\index{concentration of measure}\emph{concentration of measure phenomenon}
