\subsection*{Round circles in $\mathbb{S}^3$}

\begin{pr}{\easy}{Round circles in $\mathbb{S}^3$}\label{Round circles}
Suppose that you have a finite collection of pairwise linked round circles in the unit 3-sphere, 
not necessarily all of the same radius. 
Prove that there is an isotopy of the collection of circles 
which moves all of them into great circles.
\end{pr}


\parit{Semisolution.}
For each circle consider the plane containing it.
Note that the circles are linked 
if and only if 
the corresponding planes intersect at a single point inside the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^3\subset \RR^4$.

Take the intersection of the planes with the sphere of radius $R\ge 1$,
rescale and pass to the limit as $R\to\infty$.  
This way we get needed isotopy.\qeds

The problem was discussed 
by Genevieve Walsh in \cite{walsh}.

\subsection*{Right-angled polyhedron\thm}

A polyhedron is called {}\emph{right-angled} if all its dihedral angles are right.

\begin{pr}{\thm}{Right-angled polyhedron}\label{Right-angled polyhedron}
Show that in all sufficiently large dimensions, there is no compact convex hyperbolic right-angled polyhedron. 
\end{pr}

Let us give a short summary of Dehn--Sommerville equations 
which can help you to solve this problem.

Assume $P$ is a \index{simple polyhedron}\emph{simple} Euclidean $m$-dimensional polyhedron;
that is, every vertex of $P$ exactly $m$ facets are meeting.
Denote by $f_k$ the number of $k$-dimensional faces of $P$;
the array of integers $(f_0,f_1,\dots f_m)$ is called $f$-vector of $P$.

Fix an order of the vertices $v_1,v_2,\dots v_{f_0}$
of $P$ so that for some linear function $\ell$, we have $\ell(v_i)>\ell(v_j)\ \Leftrightarrow\ i<j$.
The \index{index of vertex}\emph{index} of the vertex $v_i$ 
is defined as the number of edges $[v_iv_j]$ such that $i<j$. 
The number of vertices of given index $k$ will be denoted as $h_k$.
The array of integers $(h_0,h_1,\dots h_m)$ is called $h$-vector of $P$.
Clearly $h_0=h_m=1$ and $h_k\ge 0$ for all $k$.

Each $k$-face of $P$ contains unique vertex which maximize $\ell$;
if the vertex has index $i$,
then $i\ge k$ and
then it is the maximal vertex for exactly $\tfrac{i!}{k!\cdot (i-k)!}$
faces of dimension $k$.
This observation can be packed in the following polynomial identity 
\[\sum_k h_k\cdot (t+1)^k=\sum_k f_k\cdot t^k.\]

Note that the identity above implies that $h$-vector does not depend on the choice of order of the vertices.
In particular, the $h$ vector is the same for the reversed order;
that is
\[h_k=h_{m-k}\]
for any $k$.
These identities are called Dehn--Sommerville equations.
It gives the complete list of linear equations for $h$-vectors (and therefore $f$-vectors) of simple polyhedrons.

\subsection*{Balls without gaps}
\label{Balls without gaps}
\begin{pr}{}{Gaps between balls}
Let $B_1,\dots,B_n$ be the balls  
of radii $r_1,\dots,r_n$ 
in a Euclidean space.
Assume that no hyperplane divides the balls into two
non-empty sets without intersecting at least one of the balls. 
Show that the balls
$B_1,\dots,B_n$ can be covered by a ball of radius
$r=r_1+\dots+r_n$.

\section*{Semisolutions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\parbf{Box in a box.}
Let $\Pi$ be a parallelepiped
with dimensions $a$, $b$ and $c$.
Denote by $v(r)$ the volume of  $r$-neighborhoods of $\Pi$,
 
Note that for all positive $r$ we have
\[v(r)=w_3+w_2\cdot r+w_1\cdot r^2+w_0\cdot r^3,\leqno({*})\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $w_0=\tfrac43\cdot \pi$ is the volume of unit ball,
\item $w_1=\pi\cdot (a+b+c)$,
\item $w_2=2\cdot(a\cdot b+b\cdot c+c\cdot a)$ is the surface area of $\Pi$,
\item $w_3=a\cdot b\cdot c$ is the volume of $\Pi$,
\end{itemize}

Assume $\Pi'$ be an other parallelepiped
with dimensions $a'$, $b'$ and $c'$.
For the volume $v'(r)$ the volume of  $r$-neighborhoods of $\Pi'$ we have a formula similar $({*})$.

If $\Pi\subset \Pi'$,
then $v(r)\le v'(r)$ for any $r$.
For $r\to\infty$, these inequalities imply
\[a+b+c\le a'+b'+c'.\]
\qedsf


The problem was discussed 
by Alexander Shen in \cite{shen}.

A formula analogous to $({*})$
holds for arbitrary convex body $B$ in arbitrary dimension $m$.
The coefficient $w_i(B)$ in the polynomial with different normalization constants 
appear under different names most commonly
\emph{intrinsic volume} and
\emph{quermassintegral}.
They also can be defined as the average 
of area of projections of $B$ to the $i$-dimensional planes.
In particular 
if $B'$ and $B$ are convex bodies such that $B'\subset B$,
then $w_i(B')\le w_i(B)$ for any $i$.
This generalize our problem quite a bit.
Further generalizations lead to so called \index{mixed volumes}\emph{mixed volumes} \cite[see][]{burago-zalgaller}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Harnack's circles.}
Let $\sigma\subset \RP^2$ be a algebraic curve of degree $d$.
Consider the complexification $\Sigma\subset \CP^2$ of $\sigma$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\Sigma$ is regular.

Prove that all regular complex algebraic curves of degree $d$ in $\RP^2$
are homeomorphic to each other; 
denote by $g$ their genus.
Perturbing a singular curve formed by  $d$ lines in $\CP^2$,
we get that 
\[g=\tfrac12\cdot(d-1)\cdot(d-2).\]

The real curve $\sigma$ forms the fixed point set in $\Sigma$ 
by the complex conjugation. 
Use it to show that $\Sigma\backslash\sigma$ has at most 2 connected components.

It follows that each connected component of $\sigma$ adds at least one to the genus of $\Sigma$.
Hence the result follows.
\qeds
 
The inequality was originally proved 
by Axel Harnack using a different method \cite[see][]{harnack}.
The idea to use complexification is due to Felix Klein \cite[see][]{klein}.
This problem formed the background to Hilbert's 16th problem \cite[see][]{hilbert-problems}. 






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Two points on each line.}
Take any complete ordering of the set of all lines 
so that each beginning interval has cardinality less than continuum.

Assume we have a set of points $X$ such that each line intersects $X$ at most $2$ points and cardinality of $X$ is less than continuum.

Choose the least line $\ell$ in the ordering which intersect $X$ 
by $0$ or $1$ point.
Note that the set of all lines intersecting $X$ at two points has cardinality less than continuum.
Therefore we can choose a point on $\ell$ and add it to $X$ so that the remaining lines are not overloaded.

It remains to apply well ordering principle.
\qeds

This problem has endless list of variations.
The following problem look similar but far more involved;
a solution follows from the proof that a square cannot be cut into triangles of equal area given given by Paul Monsky in \cite{monsky}.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Subdivide the plane into three everywhere dense sets $A$, $B$ and $C$ such that each line meets exactly two of these sets.}
\end{itemize}

\parbf{Kissing number.}
Fix $m$ and set $n=\mathop{\rm kiss} B$.
Let $B_1,B_2,\dots, B_n$ the copies of the ball $B$  
which touch $B$ and have no common interior points.
For each $B_i$ consider the vector $v_i$ from the center of $B$ to the center of $B_i$.
Note that $\measuredangle(v_i,v_j)\ge \tfrac\pi3$ if $i\ne j$.

For each $i$,
consider supporting hyperplane $\Pi_i$
to $W$
with outer normal vector $v_i$.
Denote by $W_i$ the reflection of $W$ in $\Pi_i$.

Prove that $W_i$ and $W_j$ have no common interior points if $i\ne j$;
the latter gives the needed inequality.
\qeds

The proof is given by 
Charles Halberg, 
Eugene Levin 
and Ernst Straus 
in \cite{halberg-levin-straus}.
It is not known if the same inequality holds for the orientation-preserving version of kissing number.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Monotonic homotopy.}
Note that we can assume
that $h_0(F)$ and $h_1(F)$ both lie in the coordinate $m$-spaces of $\RR^{2\cdot m}=\RR^m\times \RR^m$;
that is,
$h_0(F)\z\subset\RR^m\times\{0\}$
and $h_1(F)\subset  \{0\}\times\RR^m$.

Show that the following homotopy is monotonic
\[h_t(x)=\bigl(h_0(x)\cdot \cos\tfrac{\pi\cdot t}2
\,,\,
 h_1(x)\cdot\sin\tfrac{\pi\cdot t}{2}\bigr).\] 
\qedsf

This homotopy was discovered by Ralph Alexander in \cite{ralexander}.
It has number of applications, 
one of the most beautiful is the given 
by K\'aroly Bezdek 
and Robert Connelly \cite{bezdek-connelly} 
in their proof of 
Kneser--Poulsen  
and Klee--Wagon conjectures in dimension $2$.

The dimension $2\cdot m$ is optimal;
that is, for any positive integer $m$,
there are two maps $h_0,h_1\:F\to \RR^m$ which cannot be connected by a monotonic homotopy $h_t\:F\to\RR^{2\cdot m-1}$.
The latter was shown by Maria Belk and Robert Connelly in \cite{belk-connelly}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Cube.}
Consider the cube $[-1,1]^m\subset \RR^m$.
Any vertex this cube has the form $\bm{q}=(q_1,q_2,\dots,q_m)$,
where  $q_i=\pm1$.

For each vertex $\bm{q}$,
consider the intersection of the corresponding octant with the unit sphere;
that is, the set
\[V_{\bm{q}}=\set{(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_m)\in\mathbb{S}^{m-1}}{q_i\cdot x_i\ge 0\ \text{for each}\ i}.\]

Consider the set $\mathcal{A}\subset\mathbb{S}^{m-1}$
formed by the union of all the sets $V_{\bm{q}}$ for black $\bm{q}$.
Note that 
\[\vol_{m-1}\mathcal{A}=\tfrac12\cdot\vol_{m-1}\mathbb{S}^{m-1}\]
and 
\[\vol_{m-2}\partial\mathcal{A}
=
\tfrac k{2^{m-1}}\cdot\vol_{m-2}\mathbb{S}^{m-2},\]
where $k$ is the number of edges of the cube with one end black and the other in white.

It remains to  show that 
\[\vol_{m-2}\partial\mathcal{A}
\ge \vol_{m-2}\mathbb{S}^{m-2}.\]
The latter follows from the isoperimetric inequality for $\mathbb{S}^m$. 
\qeds

The problem was suggested by Greg Kuperberg.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Geodesic loop.}
Assume such loop exists; denote it by $\gamma$ and let $v$ be its base vertex.

Denote by $\xi$ and $\zeta$ the directions of exit and the entrance of the loop.
Let $\alpha$ be the angle between $\xi$ and $\zeta$
measured in the tangent cone to the surface of cube at $v$.

Prove that $\alpha=\tfrac\pi2$.
To do this you can use Gauss--Bonnet theorem;
alternatively, you may look at the unfolding of $\gamma$ on the plane.

It follows that there is a rotational symmetry of cube with order 3 which fix $v$ and sends $\xi$ to $\zeta$.
The later leads to a contradiction.
\qeds

For the surface of a higher dimensional cube,
the same idea provides existence of symmetry of the cube which fix $v$ and swaps $\xi$ and $\zeta$.
From this point one can arrive to a contradiction, but it is harder.

The same statement holds for tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron.
In this case $\alpha$ is a multiple of $\tfrac\pi3$;
it implies existence of rotational symmetry of which fix $v$ and sends $\xi$ to $\zeta$ and leads to a contradiction the same way.

For the dodecahedron such loop exists;
its development shown on the diagram.
(The vertices of a cube inscribed in the dodecahedron are circled.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Right and acute triangles.}
Denote by $K$ the convex hull of $\{x_1,\z\dots,x_n\}$.
Without loss of generality we can assume that $K$ is non-degenerate polytope. 
Note that for any distinct $x_i$ and $x_j$
and any interior point $z$ in $K$
we have 
\[\measuredangle \hinge{x_i}{x_j}z<\tfrac\pi2.\]

Denote by $h_i$ the homothety with center at $x_i$ and coefficient $\tfrac12$.
Set $K_i=h_i(K)$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{31 mm}

\lbl[t]{7.4,17;$z_j$}
\lbl[b]{15,17;$K$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Let us show that $K_i$ and $K_j$ have no common interior point.
Assume contrary; 
that is, \[z=h_i(z_i)=h_j(z_j);\]
for some interior points $z_i$ and $z_j$ in $K$.
Note that 
\[
\measuredangle\hinge{x_i}{x_j}{z_i}
+
\measuredangle\hinge{x_j}{x_i}{z_j}
=
\pi,
\]
which contradicts the claim.

Note that $K_i\subset K$ for any $i$;
it follows that 
\begin{align*}
\tfrac n{2^m}\cdot \vol K
&=\sum_{i=1}^n\vol K_i\le
\\
&\le\vol K.
\end{align*}
Hence the result follows.
\qeds

The problem was posted by Paul Erd{\H{o}}s in \cite{erdos}
and solved by Ludwig Danzer and Branko Gr\"unbaum in \cite{danzer-guenbaum}.
Under the name {}\emph{Angels in Space},
this problem appears in the {}\emph{connoisseur's collection}  \cite{winkler} of Peter Winkler.

Grigori Perelman noticed that the same proof works for a similar problem for Alexandrov space \cite[see][]{perelman-Erdos};
the later led to interesting connections to the crystallographic groups \cite[see][]{lebedeva}.

The upper bound for the number of points with only acute triangles grows exponentially with $m$;
the later was shown by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Zolt\'an F\"uredi in \cite{erdos-fueredi};
the proof use so called \index{probabilistic method}\emph{probabilistic method}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Right-angled polyhedron.}
Let $P$ be a right-angled hyperbolic polyhedron of dimension $m$.
Note that $P$ is simple; 
that is, exactly $m$ facets meet at each vertex of $P$.

From the projective model of hyperbolic plane, 
one can see that for any simple compact hyperbolic polyhedron there is a simple Euclidean polyhedron with the same combinatorics. 
In particular Dehn--Sommerville equations hold for $P$.

Denote by $(f_0,f_1,\dots f_m)$ and $(h_0,h_1,\dots h_m)$ the $f$- and $h$-vectors of $P$.
Recall that $h_i\ge 0$ for any $i$ and $h_0=h_m=1$.
By Dehn--Sommerville equations, we get
\[f_2> \tfrac{m-2}4\cdot f_1.
\leqno({*})\]

Since $P$ is hyperbolic, each 2-dimensional face of $P$ has at least 5 sides.
It follows that
\[f_2\le \tfrac{m-1}5\cdot f_1.\]
The latter contradicts $({*})$ for $m\ge 6$.
\qeds
 
The proof above 
is the core of proof of nonexistence of compact hyperbolic Coxeter's polyhedra of large dimensions 
given by Ernest Vinberg in \cite{vinberg}, 
see also \cite{vinberg-strong}.

Playing a bit more with the same inequalities, 
one gets nonexistence of  right-angled hyperbolic polyhedra,
in all dimensions starting from $5$.
In 4-dimensional case, an example of a bonded right-angled hyperbolic polyhedron
can be found among regular \index{120-cells}\emph{120-cells} --- the 4-dimensional brothers of dodecahedra.

Denote by $z$  the center of mass of the balls.

The statement was conjectured by Paul Erd\H{o}s.
The solution is given by Adolph and Ruth Goodmans in
\cite{goodman-goodman}.
A variation was given later by Hugo Hardwiger in \cite{hadwiger}.
