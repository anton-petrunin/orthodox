<p>
Problems for the graduate students who want to
improve their problem solving skills in geometry.
</p>
<p>
I am collecting these problems for fun.
Every problem has a short elegant solution â€”
this gives a hint which was not available
when it was solved for the first time.
</p>

<p> It is downlaodable at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.0290">arXiv</a>, 
and here is <a href="problems.pdf">the latest version</a>.
</p>

<p>
Please email me a correcitons and also new problems which might be good for this list.
