\section*{Preface}

For me puzzles are contagious problems --- they might be pleasant or unpleasant, but once you start to think about them it is hard to stop.
It does not really matter if the puzzle has a solution, altho knowing that a simple solution exists might make it more even more contagious.
Usually, when I think about a puzzle, I see many things to grip, but I do not have enuf hands (otherwise I would call it a conjecture, especially if it is important in some way).

Originally I thought to include this collection in my collection of solved puzzles ???, but a book format does not suite the goal.
Send me an email if you solve one of the problems, or have a good idea how to solve it.
