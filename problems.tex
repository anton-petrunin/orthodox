\chapter{Comparison geometry}

\comment{For doing most of problems in this section it is enough to know second variation formula. 
Knowledge of some basic results such as 
O'Neil formula, 
Gauss formula, 
Gauss--Bonnet theorem, 
Toponogov's comparison theorem, 
Soul theorem, 
Toponogov splitting theorems 
and Synge's lemma 
also might help.
We suggest to solve problem~\ref{Immersed surface}
before solving problem~\ref{Immersed convex hypersurface II}, 
To solve problem~\ref{kleiner-hopf}, it is better know that factor positively curved Riemannian manifold by an isometry group is a positively curved Alexandrov space.
Problem \ref{scalar-curv} requires Liouville's theorem for geodesic flow.
Problem~\ref{hS=>S} requires a Bochner type formula.

\chapter{letter of S. Tabachnikov}

Dear AHTOH, here are my (sorry, much belated!) comments on your list
of geometry problems. I will be happy to provide more details if you
wish. Do you include open problems? Privet, Serezha

1. Spiral. A reference to Kneser's theorem is appropriate: as long as
the curvature is monotonic, the osculating circles are nested.???

2. A curve in a sphere. Isn't it an immediate consequence of integral
geometry (length=const \times average number of intersections with
great circles)?

3.

4. Convex polygon. This is known as Cauchy Lemma; this was the main
ingredient in his proof that convex polyhedra in 3-space are rigid.

5. Convex triangulations. I think, this is discussed, with
references, in Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky book.

6. Short curve in a sphere. Doesn't it follow from integral geometry
that every open interval of this curve doesn't intersect some grat
circle?

7. Transversal foliation. To this I'd add that a non-vanishing
divergence free vector field on a closed 3-mfld with finite
fundamental group is not tangent to any foliation. This is proved in
my 1989 Func. Anal. note.

I don't know whether the following results qualifies for your list.

A. Given partition of a square into triangles of equal areas, the
number of triangles is even. There are many generalizations. E.g.,
the same holds for a centrally symmetric polygon. There is literature
on this subject.

B. Let G be a closed convex plane curve and g a closed immersed curve
inside G. Then average absolute curvature (g) \geq that of G, with
equality iff g is G, possibly traversed more than once. Average
absolute curvature = integral of abs. value of curvature divided by
total length.
For G a circle, this is an old Fary theorem (I know a few proofs);
for arbitrary G this was proved recently (there are two papers).



\chapter{letter of P. Petersen}

Peter Petersen 	to Anton

I'll be happy to make a few corrections.
In the problem a la Abresch-Gromoll you use Minkowski space for finite
dimensional normed vector space. This is a bit confusing to those who
think of Minkowski spaces as space-times!
In the Immerses convex hypersurface problem the third and last question
should say nonnegative (sectional) curvature rather than nonpositive which
is the second question.
In Fixed points of conformal mappings the dimension should be even? The
antipodal map on S^3 has no fixed points. Actually you might want to say
that in even dimensions the map is orientation preserving and in odd
dimensions it is orientation reversing. Then the problem should be
correct.

And here are two problems I have always liked.
1. Show that if a
simply connected
compact positively curved manifold admits a totally geodesic hypersurface,
then it is a sphere. Actually one just needs to know that the hypersurface
is two sided.
2. Show that two minimal hypersufaces in positive Ricci curvature must
intersect.

Best regards, Peter
