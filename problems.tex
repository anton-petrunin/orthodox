\chapter{Comparison geometry}

\comment{For most of trhe problems it is enough to know second variation formula. 
Knowledge of  
O'Neil formula, 
Gauss formula, 
Gauss--Bonnet formula, 
Toponogov's comparison theorem, 
Soul theorem, 
Toponogov splitting theorems 
and Synge's lemma

We suggest to solve problem~\ref{Immersed surface}
before solving problem~\ref{Immersed convex hypersurface II}.
To solve problem~\ref{kleiner-hopf}, 
it is better know that the quotient of positively curved Riemannian manifold

Problem \ref{scalar-curv} requires Liouville's theorem for geodesic flow.
