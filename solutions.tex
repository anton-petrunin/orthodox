\textit{Spiral.}
Without loss of generality we may assume that the curvature of $\gamma$ decreases in $t$.

Let $z(t)$ be the center of osculating circle at $\gamma(t)$
and $r(t)$ is its radius.
Prove that 
$$|z'(t)|\le r'(t).$$

Conclude that the osculating discs are nested;
that is, $D_{t_1}\supset D_{t_0}$ for $t_1>t_0$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
The problem can be considered as a continuous analog of the Leibniz's test for alternating series.

It seems that the problem first discovered by Peter Tait in \cite{tait}
and later rediscovered by Adolf Kneser in \cite{kneser};
see also \cite{ovsienko-tabachnikov}.

\textit{The moon in the puddle.}
Consider the {\it cut locus} $T$
of $F$ with respect to $\partial F$;
it is defined as the closure
of the set of points $x\in F$ 
such that there are two or more points in $\partial F$ which minimize distance to $x$.

Note that after a small perturbation
of $\partial F$ we may assume that
$T$ is a graph embedded in
$F$ with finite number of edges.

Note that $T$ is a
deformation retract of $F$.
The retraction can be obtained by moving each point $y\in F\setminus T$ to $T$
along the geodesic from the closest point to $y$ on $\partial F$ which pass through $y$.

In particular, $T$ is a tree.
Therefore $T$  has
at least two end vertices;
Denote one of them by $z$.

Prove that the disc of radius $1$ centered at $z$ lies completely in $F$.

\parit{Comments.} 
The statement still holds if the curve fails to be smooth at one point.
A spherical version of this statement 
was used by Dmitri Panov and me 
in \cite{panov-petrunin-ramification}.

The analog of this statement in 3-dimensional case does not work.
Namely, there is a smooth embedding $\mathbb{S}^2\hookrightarrow \RR^3$ 
with all the principle curvatures between $-1$ and $1$
such that it does not surround a ball of radius 1.
Such example can be obtained by fattening 
a nontrivial example of a contractible 2-complex in $\RR^3$,
say Bing's house will do
\cite[see][]{bing}.

A similar argument shows that
for any point $p\in (\mathbb S^2,g)$ there is a minimizing geodesic $[pq]$ with conjugate ends.
On the other hand, 
for $(\mathbb S^3,g)$ this is not true.
In fact, 
there are Riemannian metrics on $\mathbb{S}^3$ 
without minimizing geodesics with conjugate ends
[see the comments for Problem \ref{almost-flat}].


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{curve-in-S^2}.}
\textit{A curve in a sphere.}
Assume that $\alpha$ is a closed curve in $\mathbb{S}^2$ of length $2\cdot\ell$ which intersects each equator.
Let us present two solutions.

\parit{A solution with the Crofton formula.}
Note that we can assume that $\alpha$ is a broken line.

Given a unit vector $u$ denote by $e_u$ the equator with pole at $u$.
Let $k(u)$ the number of intersections
of the $\alpha$ and $e_u$.

Note that for almost all $u\in \mathbb{S}^2$, the value $k(u)$ is even.
Since each equator intersects $\alpha$, we get $k(u)\ge 2$ for almost all $u$.

Then we get
\begin{align*}
2\cdot\ell&=\tfrac14\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2}k(u)\cdot\, d_u\area\ge 
\\
&\ge\tfrac12\cdot\area\mathbb{S}^2=
\\
&=2\cdot\pi.
\end{align*}
The first identity above is called \emph{Crofton formula};
prove it first for one geodesic segment in $\alpha$ and then sum it up for all segments in $\alpha$.

\parit{Solution with symmetry.}
Let $\check\alpha$ be a sub-arc of $\alpha$ of length $\ell$, with endpoints $p$ and $q$.  
Let $z$ be the midpoint of a minimizing geodesic $[pq]$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$.  

Let $r$ be a point of intersection of $\alpha$ with the equator with pole at $z$.  
Without loss of generality we may assume that $r\in\check\alpha$. 

The arc $\check\alpha$ together with its reflection in $z$ 
form a closed curve of length $2\cdot \ell$ 
that passes through $r$ and its antipodal point $r'$.
Therefore 
\[\ell=\length \check\alpha\ge |r-r'|_{\mathbb S^2}=\pi.\]

\parit{Comments.} 
The problem was suggested by Nikolai Nadirashvili;
it is a the first step 
in the proof of Reshetnyak's majorization theorem for $\CAT[1]$ spaces  \cite[see][]{akp}.
 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{A spring in a tin}.} \textit{A spring in a tin.}
Let $\alpha$ be a closed curve in the unit disc;
denote by $\ell$ its length.

Let us equip the plane with complex coordinates so that $0$ is the center of the unit disc.
We can assume that $\alpha$ equipped with $\ell$-periodic parametrization by length.

Consider the curve $\beta(t)=t-\tfrac{\alpha(t)}{\alpha'(t)}$.
Note that 
\[\beta(t+\ell)=\beta(t)+\ell\] 
for any $t$.
In particular 
\[\length (\beta|_{[0,\ell]}) 
\ge 
|\beta(\ell)-\beta(0)|
=
\ell.\]

Note that 
\begin{align*}
|\beta'(t)|&=|\tfrac{\alpha(t)\cdot\alpha''(t)}{\alpha'(t)^2}|\le
\\
&\le|\alpha''(t)|.
\end{align*}
Since $|\alpha''(t)|$ is the curvature of $\alpha$ at $t$,
we get the result.

\parit{Comment.}
The statement was originally proved 
by Istv\'an F\'ary in \cite{fary};
number of different proofs are discussed by Serge Tabachnikov in \cite{tabachnikov}.

If instead of a disc, 
we have a region bounded by closed convex curve $\gamma$, 
then it is still true that the average curvature of $\alpha$ is at least as big as average curvature of $\gamma$. 
The proof was given by Jeffrey Lagarias
and Thomas Richardson in \cite{lagarias-richardson}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Surrounded area}.}
\textit{Surrounded area.}
Denote by $C_1$ and $C_2$ the compact regions bounded by $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ correspondingly.

By Kirszbraun theorem, 
any short map $X\to \RR^2$ defined on $X\subset \RR^2$
can be extended to a short map on the whole $\RR^2$.
In particular, there is a short map $f\:\RR^2\to\RR^2$ 
such that $f(\gamma_2(v))=f(\gamma_1(v))$ for any $v\in\mathbb S^1$.

Note that $f(C_2)\supset C_1$.
Whence the statement follows.

\parit{Comments.}
The Kirszbraun theorem appears in his thesis \cite[see][]{kirszbraun}
and reproved later by Frederick Valentine in \cite{valentine}.

\parbf{\ref{Convex figures}.}
\textit{Convex figures.}
Consider the set $\Omega_n$ of all convex figures $F\subset\RR^2$ 
such that for any $x\z\in\partial F$ there are $y,z\z\in F$ such that
$\measuredangle \hinge xyz>\pi-\tfrac1n$.

Prove that $\Omega_n$ 
is open and dense in $\mathfrak{C}$.
Finally note that the intersection
$\bigcap_n\Omega_n$
forms the subset of all smooth figures in $\mathfrak{C}$.  

\parit{Comments.} 
Number of similar problems are surveyed by Tudor Zamfirescu in \cite{zamfirescu}.

\parbf{\ref{Complicated circle}.} 
\textit{Complicated circle.}
A continuous function $f\:[0,1]\to [0,1]$
will be called $\eps$-crooked 
if $f(0)=0$, $f(1)=1$ 
and for any segment $[a,b]\subset [0,1]$ 
one can choose $a\le x\le y\le b$ 
such that
\[|f(y)-f(a)|\le\eps\ \ \text{and}\ \ |f(x)-f(b)|\le\eps.\]

A sequence of $\tfrac1n$-crooked maps can be constructed recursively. 
Guess the construction from the diagram.

Start with the unit circle, 
$\gamma_0(t)=(\cos \tfrac{t}{2\cdot\pi},\sin \tfrac{t}{2\cdot\pi})$.
Construct recursively a sequence of simple closed curves $\gamma_n\:[0,1]\to\RR^2$.
Such that $\gamma_{n+1}$ runs outside of the disc bounded by $\gamma_n$
and 
\[|\gamma_{n+1}(t)-\gamma_n\circ f_n(t)|<\eps_n,\]
for some $\eps_n$-crooked function $f_n\:[0,1]\to[0,1]$.

\end{wrapfigure}

On the diagram you see an attempt to draw the first iteration.

Denote by $D$ the union of all discs bounded by $\gamma_n$.
Show that $D$ is homeomorphic to an open disc 
and for the right choice of the $\eps_n$ the set $D$ is bounded and its
boundary contains no simple curves.


\parit{Comments.} The proof repeats the construction of pseudo-arc 
given by Bronis\l{}aw Knaster in \cite{knaster}.
Let us list a few problems which can be solved the same way.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Construct three disjoint non-empty open sets in $\RR$ which have the same boundary.}
\item {\it Construct three open discs in $\RR^2$ which have the same boundary.}
(This examples are called \emph{lakes of Wada};
these are disjoint open discs in the plane which have identical boundary.   
This example described by Kuniz\^{o} Yoneyama in \cite{yoneyama}.)
\item {\it Construct a Cantor set in $\RR^3$ with non simply connected complement.}
(This example was is called  \emph{Antoine's necklace};
it is constructed in \cite{antoine}.)

\textit{Fat curve.} 
Modify your favorite space filling curve 
keeping area nearly the same 
and removing the self-intersections.

Say, you can modify the Sierpi\'nski curve 
which can be constructed as a limit of 
recursively defined sequence of curves;
the 8th iteration is on the diagram.

The existence of such curves was observed 
by William Osgood in \cite{osgood}.

\parbf{\ref{Rectifiable curve}.}
\textit{Rectifiable curve.}
The 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure will be denoted as $\mathcal{H}_1$. 

Set $L=\mathcal{H}_1(K)$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $K$ has diameter $1$.

Assume that $0<\eps<\tfrac12$.
Prove that 
\[\mathcal{H}_1(B(x,\eps)\cap K)\ge\eps\leqno(*)\]
for any $x\in K$.

Let $x_1,\dots, x_n$ be a maximal set of points in $K$ such that 
\[|x_i-x_j|\z\ge\eps\] for all $i\ne j$. 
From $(*)$ we have $n\le2\cdot L/\eps$.

Construct a curve $\gamma_\eps$ such that (1) $\gamma_\eps$ is passing through all $x_i$, (2) $\length\gamma_\eps\le10\cdot L$ and (3) $\gamma_\eps$ lies in $\eps$-neighborhood of $K$.
We can assume that $\gamma_\eps$ is parametrized by length.

The needed curve can be obtained by passing to 
a partial limit of $\gamma_\eps$
 as $\eps\to 0$. 

\parit{Comments.}
This problem was given as an exercise 
in the book of Kenneth Falconer \cite[see][Ex. 3.5]{falconer}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Capture a sphere in a knot}.}
\textit{Capture a sphere in a knot.}
We can assume that the knot is given by a diagram on the the sphere.

Fix a M\"obius transformation $\mathbb{S}^2\to\mathbb{S}^2$ which is not an isometry.
Denote by $u$ its conformal factor. 
Since the M\"obius transformation preserves total area, 
we get 
$$\frac1{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2} u^2=1.$$ 
Therefore, 
$$\frac1{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2} u<1.$$ 
It follows that after a suitable rotation of $\mathbb{S}^2$, 
the length of the knot decreases.

The same way one gets 
a continuous one parameter family of M\"obius transformations which moves the knot in a hemisphere 
and allows the ball to escape. 

\parit{Comments.}
This is a problem of Zarathustra Brady, 
the idea in the solution is due to David Eppstein \cite[see][]{zeb}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{linked-circles}.}
\textit{Linked circles.} 
Denote the linked circels by $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Fix a point $x\in\alpha$. 
Note that one can find another point $x'\in\alpha$ such that the interval 
$[xx']$ intersects $\beta$, say at the point $z$. 
Otherwise we can move each point of $\alpha$ along the line segment to $x$.
This deformation of $\alpha$ will not cross $\beta$;
the latter contradicts that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are linked. 


Consider the curve $\alpha'$ which is the central projection of $\alpha$ 
from $z$ onto the unit sphere around $z$;
clearly
$$\length \alpha\ge \length\alpha'.$$

Note that $\alpha'$ passes through two antipodal points of the sphere;
therefore 
$$\length \alpha'\ge 2\cdot\pi.$$
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
This is the simplest case of so called \emph{Gehring's problem}. 
The solution above was given by Michael Edelstein and Binyamin Schwarz in \cite{edelstein-schwatz};
later the same solution was rediscovered few times.

\parbf{\ref{Oval in oval}.}
\textit{Oval in oval.}
Show that the chord which minimizes (or maximizes) the ratio, 
in which it divides the bigger oval, 
solves the problem.


\parit{Alternative solution.}
Given a unit vector $u$, denote by $x_u$ the point on the inner curve
with outer normal vector $u$.
Draw a chord of outer curve which is tangent to the inner curve at $x_u$;
denote by $r=r(u)$ and $l=l(u)$ the lengths of this chord at the right and left from $x_u$.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{51 mm}

\lbl[rt]{18,15;$r$}
\lbl[rt]{26,6;$l$}
\lbl[bl]{25,10;$x_u$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Arguing by contradiction, assume $r(u)\ne l(u)$ for any $u\in\mathbb{S}^1$.
Since the functions $r$ and $l$ are continuous,
we can assume that 
$$r(u)>l(u)\ \ \text{for any}\ \ u\in\mathbb{S}^1.\leqno{({*})}$$

Prove that
each of the following two integrals 
\begin{align*}
\tfrac12\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^1}r^2(u)\cdot du
\quad\text{and}\quad
\tfrac12\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^1}l^2(u)\cdot du
\end{align*}
gives 
the area between the curves.
In particular, 
the integrals are equal to each other. 
The latter contradicts $({*})$.



\parit{Comments.} This is a problem of Serge Tabachnikov \cite[see][]{tabachnikob-mi}.
A closely related, so called \emph{equal tangents problem} is discussed by the same author in \cite{tabachnikov-tan}.

\parbf{\ref{Convex hat}.}
\textit{Convex hat.}
Let $\gamma$ be a minimizing geodesic with the ends in $\Delta$.

Assume $\gamma\backslash\Delta\ne\emptyset$.
Denote by $\gamma'$ the curve formed by $\gamma\cap \Delta$ 
and the reflection on $\gamma\backslash\Delta$ in $\Pi$.
Note 
\[\length\gamma'=\length\gamma\]
and $\gamma'$ runs partly inside and partly outside of the surface, but does not get inside of $\Sigma$.

Denote by $\gamma''$ the closest point projection of $\gamma'$ on $\Sigma$.
The curve $\gamma''$ lies in $\Sigma$ has the same ends as $\gamma$.

It remains to note that 
\[\length\gamma''<\length\gamma;\]
the latter leads to a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{Unbended geodesic}.} 
\textit{Unbended geodesic.}
Let $W$ be the closed unbounded set formed by $\Sigma$ and its exterior points.

Prove that for any $x\in\Sigma$ the distance $|x - p_t|$ is non-decreasing in $t$.

Use the latter statement, to prove the same for $|x - p_t|_W$,
where $|x - p_t|_W$ stays for the intrinsic distance from $x$ to $p_t$ in $W$.

Prove that 
\[|q - p|_W=|q - p|_\Sigma\] 
for any $p,q\in\Sigma$.


Conclude that the distance $|q - p_t|_W=|q - p|_\Sigma$
for any $t$.
It follows that the curve 
$$\gamma_t(\tau)=\left[
\begin{aligned}
&(\tau-t)\cdot\gamma'(\tau)&&\text{if}&&\tau< t;
\\
&\gamma(\tau)&&\text{if}&&\tau> t.
\end{aligned}
\right.$$
is a minimizing geodesic from $p_t$ to $q$ in the intrinsic metric of $W$. 

If $q$ is visible from $p_t$ for some $t$ then the line segment $[qp_t]$ intersects $\Sigma$ only at $q$.
From above, 
$\gamma_t$  coincides with the line segment $[qp_t]$ which is impossible.

This  observation was used by Anatoliy Milka
to generalize Alexandrov's comparison theorem for convex surfaces \cite[see][]{milka-geod}.

\parbf{\ref{Corkscrew geodesic}.}
\textit{Corkscrew geodesic.}
An example can be found among the surfaces of convex polyhedrons 
such that the non-degenerate intersections with horizontal planes are triangles with parallel sides.

The polyhedron $K$ should look like a vertical needle. 
On the surface of $K$ there are three broken lines, 
formed by the corresponding vertices of triangles.
The polyhedron can be made in such a way that any minimizing geodesic from the top of $K$ to its bottom
has to cross these lines in the cyclic order at nearly each edge, and the number of edges can be made arbitrary large. 
(The projection of geodesic spirals around the origin.)

\parit{Comments.} 
The construction is due to 
Imre B\'ar\'any, 
Krystyna Kuiperberg 
and Tudor Zamfirescu \cite[see][]{imre-kuiperberg-zamfirescu}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Long geodesic}.}
\textit{Long geodesic.}
Denote by $a$ the area of the surface.

Cut the surface along a long closed simple geodesic $\gamma$.
We get two discs with non-negative curvature and large perimeter, 
say $\ell$.
Note that the area of each disc is bounded above by $a$.

Choose one of the discs $D$ and equip it with the intrinsic metric.
Note that $D$ is non-negatively curved in the sense of Alexandrov.
Denote by $p$ and $q$ be the points in $D$ which lie at the maximal distance from each other.

Fix $\eps>0$.
Fix a geodesic $[pq]$ in $D$.
Show that if $\ell$ is large enough in terms of $\eps$,
then 
the distance from any point in $D$ to $[pq]$ is at most $\eps$
and the curvature of $\eps$-neighborhood of $p$ in $D$
is at least $\pi-\eps$.

By Gauss--Bonnet formula the total curvature of $\Sigma$ is $4\cdot\pi$.
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, we get that there are 4 point in $\Sigma$, each with curvature $\pi$
and the remaining part of $\Sigma$ is flat.

\begin{lpic}[t(-3 mm),b(-2 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/akopyan(1)}

It remains to show that any surface with this property 
is isometric to the surface of a tetrahedron with equal opposite edges.
To do this cut $\Sigma$ along three geodesics which connect one singular point to the remaining three,
develop the obtained flat surface on the plane and think (also look at the diagram).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{liberman}.} 
\textit{Geodesics for birds.}
Consider a geodesic 
\[t\mapsto(x(t),y(t),z(t))\] 
in $W$;
assume it is defined in the interval $\II\subset \RR$.
Let us denote by $\phi$ the total curvature;
it is a measure on $\II$.
We need to estimate $\phi(\II)$.

Denote by $s=s(t)$ the natural parameter of the plane curve \[t\mapsto (x(t),y(t)).\]

Prove that the function $f\:s\mapsto z$ is concave.

Given a semi-open interval $\mathbb J=(a,b]\subset \II$,
set
$\mu(\mathbb J)=f^+(a)-f^+(b)$,
where $f^+$ denotes right derivatives.
The function $\mu$ extends to a measure which could be also written as
\[\mu=\tfrac{dz^2}{d^2s}\cdot ds.\]
if $\tfrac{dz^2}{d^2s}$ understood in the sense of distribution.
 
Note that $|\tfrac{dz}{ds}|\le \ell$.
In particular, $\mu(\II)\le 2\cdot\ell$.

Further note that $\phi\le \sqrt{1+\ell^2}\cdot\mu$.
In particular, 
$$\phi(\II)\le 2\cdot\ell\cdot\sqrt{1+\ell^2}.$$

A straightforward improvement of these estimates gives 
$$\phi(\II)\le 2\cdot\ell.$$
This bound is optimal, check a both side infinite geodesic on the graph of  \[f(x,y)=-\ell\cdot\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.\]

\parit{Comments.}
The problem is due to David Berg \cite[see][]{berg}.
The main observation (the concavity of the function $s\mapsto z$)
is called \emph{Liberman’s lemma}; 
it was used earlier 
to bound the total curvature
of a geodesic on a convex surface \cite[see][]{liberman}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Simple geodesic}.} 
\textit{Simple geodesic.}
Let $\gamma$ be a two-sided infinite geodesic in $\Sigma$.
The following is the key statement in the proof.

\parbf{Claim.}
{\it The geodesic $\gamma$ contains at most one simple loop.}
\medskip

To prove the claim use the following observations.
\begin{itemize}
\item The integral curvature $\omega$ of $\Sigma$ cannot exceed $2\cdot\pi$.
\item If $\phi$ is the angle at the base of a simple geodesic loop then the integral curvature surrounded by the loop equals to $\pi+\phi$.
\end{itemize}

Once the claim is proved, 
note that, 
if a geodesic $\gamma$ has a self-intersection,
then it contains a simple loop.
From above there is only one such loop;
it cuts a disc from $\Sigma$ 
and can go around it either clockwise or counterclockwise.
This way we divide all the self-intersecting geodesics 
into two sets which we will call \emph{clockwise} and \emph{counterclockwise}.

Note that the geodesic $t\mapsto \gamma(t)$ is clockwise 
if and only if 
$t\mapsto \gamma(-t)$
is counterclockwise.
The sets of clockwise and counterclockwise are open and the space of geodesics is connected. 
It follows that there are geodesics 
which are, neither clockwise, nor counterclockwise;
by the definition, these geodesics have no self-intersections.

\parit{Comments.}
This idea is due to 
Victor Bangert \cite[see][Cor. 2]{bangert}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{min-surf}.} 
\textit{A minimal surface.}
Without loss of generality we may assume that the sphere is centered at $0\in\RR^3$.

Consider the restriction $h$ of the function $x\mapsto |x|^2$ to the surface $\Sigma$.
Prove that $\Delta_\Sigma h\le 4$ and apply apply the divergence theorem for $\nabla_\Sigma h$.
It follows that the function
\[f\:r\mapsto \frac{\area(\Sigma\cap B(0,r))}{r^2}
\]
is non-decreasing in the interval $(0,1)$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
We described a partial case of so called \emph{monotonicity formula}.

The same argument shows that if $0$ is a double point
of $\Sigma$ then $\area\Sigma\ge 2\cdot \pi$.
This observation was used in the proof 
that the minimal disc bounded by a simple closed curve with total curvature $\le 4\cdot\pi$ 
is necessarily embedded.
The proof was given by 
Tobias Ekholm, 
Brian White
and Daniel Wienholtz
in \cite{EWW};
an amusing simplification and generalization
was obtained by 
Stephan Stadler. %???REF
This result also implies the result of John Milnor that any embedded circle of total curvature at most $4\cdot\pi$ is unknot \cite[see][]{milnor}.

Note that if we assume in addition that the surface is a disc,
then the statement holds for any saddle surface. 
Indeed, denote by $S_r$ the sphere of radius $r$ concentrated with the unit sphere. 
Then according to Problem~\ref{curve-in-S^2}, 
$\length(\Sigma\cap S_r)\ge 2\cdot\pi\cdot r$.
Then the coarea formula leads to the solution.

On the other hand there are saddle surfaces homeomorphic to the cylinder
that may have arbitrary small area in the ball. 

If $\Sigma$ does not pass through the center 
and we only know the distance, say $r$, 
from the center to $\Sigma$,
then the optimal bound is expected to be $\pi\cdot(1-r^2)$.
This is known if $\Sigma$ is homeomorphic to a disc.
This is also known for the area minimizing surfaces;
an analogous statement
holds in all dimensions and codimensions.
These results were proved by 
Herbert Alexander, 
David Hoffman
and Robert Osserman \cite[see][]{alexander-osserman,alexander-hoffman-osserman}.

\textit{Half-torus.}
Let $K$ be the convex hull of $\Omega'=\iota(\Omega)$.
Consider the boundary curve $\gamma'$ of $\partial K\cap \Omega'$ in $\Omega'$.

First note that the Gauss curvature of $\Omega'$ has to vanish at the points of $\gamma'$;
in other words, $\gamma'=\iota(\gamma)$.
Indeed since $\gamma'$ lies on convex part, 
the Gauss curvature at the points of $\gamma'$ has to be non-negative. 
On the other hand $\gamma'$ bounds a flat disc in $\partial K$;
therefore its integral intrinsic curvature has to be $2{\cdot}\pi$.
If the Gauss curvature is positive at some point of $\gamma'$, 
then total intrinsic curvature of $\gamma'$ has to be $<2{\cdot}\pi$, a contradiction.

Now prove that $\gamma'$ is an asymptotic line.
(Assume that the asymptotic direction goes transversely to $\gamma'(t)$ and conclude $\gamma(t)\notin\partial K$.)

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the length of $\gamma$ is $2{\cdot}\pi$ and its intrinsic curvature is $\equiv 1$.
Therefore, as the space curve,
$\gamma'$ has to be a curve with constant curvature $1$ and it should be closed.
Any such curve is congruent to a flat circle.

\parit{Comments.} It is not known if $\Omega'$ is congruent to $\Omega$.

The solution presented above is based on my answer 
to the question of Joseph O'Rourke \cite[see][]{rourke}.
Here are some related statements.
\begin{itemize}
\item A half-torus is second order rigid;
this was proved by Eduard Rembs in
\cite{rembs}, see also \cite[][p. 135]{efimov}.
\item Any second order rigid surface does not admit analytic deformation 
\cite[proved by Nikolay Efimov, see][p. 121]{efimov}
and for the surfaces of revolution, the assumption of analyticity can be removed 
\cite[proved by Idzhad Sabitov, see][]{sabitov}.

Passing to a finite cover, we can assume that the asymptote has no self intersections.
In this case 
the restriction $\gamma|_{[a,\infty)}$  
has no self-intersections, 
if $a$ is large large enough.

Cut $\Sigma$ along $\gamma([a,\infty))$ and then cut from the obtained surface an infinite triangle $\triangle$. 
The triangle $\triangle$ should have two sides formed by both sides of cuts along $\gamma$;
let us denote these sides of $\triangle$ by $\gamma_-$ and $\gamma_+$.
Note that 
\[\area\triangle<\area \Sigma<\infty\leqno(*)\]
and both sides $\gamma_\pm$ 
form infinite minimizing geodesics in $\triangle$.

Consider the Buseman function $f$ for $\gamma_+$;
denote by $\ell(t)$ the length of the level curve $f^{-1}(t)$.
Let $-\kappa(t)$  be the total curvature of the suplevel set $f^{-1}([t,\infty))$.  
Note that for all large $t$ we have
\[\ell'(t)=\kappa(t)

The latter implies that there is $\eps>0$ such that

this is stronger than required.

Then for each $p\in\Sigma_1$
there is unique line $\ell_p\ni p$

Note that the lines $\ell_p$ form a tangent line distribution over $\Sigma_1$

Let $D$ be the disc in $\Sigma_1$ bounded by $\gamma$.

it is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb S^2$.
The line distribution $\ell$ lifts to a line distribution on the doubling;

\parbf{\ref{Geodesic hypersurface}.} 
\textit{Geodesic hypersurface.}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a totally geodesic embedded hypersurface in $M$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\Sigma$ is connected.

The complement $M\backslash\Sigma$ has one or two connected components.
First let us show that if the number of connected components is two, 
then $M$ is homeomorphic to sphere.

By cutting $M$ along $\Sigma$ 
we get two manifolds, say $M_1$ and $M_2$,
with geodesic boundaries. 
Prove that the distance functions to the boundary 
$f_1\:M_1\to\mathbb{R}$ and $f_2\:M_2\to\mathbb{R}$ are strictly convex in the interiors of the manifolds.

Smooth the functions $f_i$ keeping them convex; 
this can be done by applying Greene--Wu Theorem \cite[see][Thm. 2]{greene-wu}.
In particular each $f_i$ has singe critical point which is its maximum.

Applying Morse lemma, we get that each manifold $M_i$ is homeomorphic to a ball; 
hence $M$ 
is homeomorphic to the sphere.

If $M\backslash\Sigma$ is connected,
passing to a double cover of $M$,
we reduce the problem to the case which already has been considered.

\parit{Comments.}
The problem was suggested by Peter Petersen.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{If convex then embedded}.} 
\textit{If convex, then embedded.}
Observe first that any closed embedded locally convex hypersurface in a non-positively curved simply connected complete manifold bounds a convex region.


Let $\Sigma$ be an immersed locally convex hypersurface in $M$.
Set 
\[m=\dim \Sigma=\dim M-1\]

Given a point in $p$ on $\Sigma$ 
denote by $p_r$ the point on distance $r$ from $p$
which lies on the geodesic starting from $p$ in the outer normal direction to $\Sigma$.
For fixed $r\ge 0$,
the points $p_r$ sweep an immersed locally convex hypersurface which we denote by $\Sigma_r$.

Fix $z\in \Sigma$.
Denote by $S_r$ the sphere of radius $r$ centered at $z$.
Note that $S_r$ is diffeomorphic to $m$-dimensional sphere.

Denote by $d$ the diameter of $\Sigma$.
Note that for all $r>0$
any point on $\Sigma_r$
lies on a distance at most $d$ from $S_r$.
Conclude that for large $r$ the closest point projection $\phi_r\:\Sigma_r\to S_r$ is an immersion.


Since $\Sigma$ is connected
and $m\ge 2$, it follows that $\phi_r$ is a diffeomorphism for all large $r$.

By the observation above, $\Sigma_r$ bounds a convex region for all large $r$.
By an open-closed argument, the same holds for all $r\ge 0$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
The problem is due to Stephanie Alexander \cite[see][]{alexander}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Immersed ball}.} 
\textit{Immersed ball.}
Equip $\Sigma$ with the induced intrinsic metric.
Denote by $\kappa$ the lower bound for principle curvatures of $\Sigma$.
Note that we can assume that $\kappa>0$.

Fix sufficiently small $\eps=\eps(M,\kappa)>0$.
Given $p\in \Sigma$ consider the lift $\tilde h_p\:B(p,\eps)\to \T_{h(p)}$ along the exponential map $\exp_{h(p)}\:\T_{h(p)}\to M$.
More precisely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect each point $q\in B(p,\eps)\subset \Sigma$ to $p$
by a minimizing geodesic  path $\gamma_q\:[0,1]\to \Sigma$
\item Consider the lifting $\tilde\gamma_q$ in $\T_{h(p)}$; 
that is the curve such that $\tilde\gamma_q(0)=0$ and $\exp_{h(p)}\circ\tilde\gamma_q(t)=\gamma_q(t)$ for any $t\in[0,1]$.
 \item Set $\tilde h(q)=\tilde\gamma_q(1)$.
\end{enumerate}

Show that all the hypersurfaces $\tilde h_p(B(p,\eps))\subset \T_{h(p)}$ has principle curvatures at least $\tfrac\kappa2$.

Use the same idea as in problem~\ref{Immersed surface} to show that 
one can fix $\delta\z=\delta(M,\kappa)>0$ such that the restriction of $\tilde h_p|_{B(p,\delta)}$ is injective.
Conclude that the restriction $h|_{B(p,\delta)}$ is injective for any $p\in\Sigma$.

Now consider locally equidistant surfaces $\Sigma_t$ in the inward direction for small $t$. 
The principle curvatures of $\Sigma_t$ remain at least $\kappa$ in the barrier sense.
By the same argument as above, any $\delta$-ball in $\Sigma_t$
is embedded.

Applying open-closed argument we get a one parameter family of locally convex locally equidistant surfaces $\Sigma_t$
for defined in a maximal interval $[0,a)$
and 
the surface $\Sigma_a$ degenerates to a point, say $p$. 

To construct the immersion $\partial \bar B^m\looparrowright M$,
take the point $p$ as the image of the center $\bar B^m$ 
and take the surfaces $\Sigma_t$ as the restrictions of the  embedding to the spheres;
the existence of the immersion follows from the Morse lemma.

\textit{Comments.}
As you see from the picture, 
the analogous statement does not hold in the two-dimensional case.

The proof presented above was indicated in the lectures of Mikhael Gromov \cite[see][]{gromov-SGMC};
it was written rigorously by Jost Eschenburg in \cite{eschenburg}.

A variation of Gromov's proof 
was obtained independently by Ben Andrews in \cite{andrews}.
Instead of equidistant deformation, 
he uses a so called \emph{inverse mean curvature flow};
this way he has to perform some calculations, but does not have to worry about non-smoothness of the hypersurfaces.

\parbf{\ref{almgren}.} 
\textit{Almgren's inequalities.}
Fix a  geodesic $n$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ in $\mathbb{S}^m$.

Given $r\in (0,\tfrac\pi2]$,
denote by $U_r$ and $\tilde U_r$ the tubular $r$-neighborhood 
of $\Sigma$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$ in $\mathbb{S}^m$ correspondingly.

Prove that $U_{\frac\pi2}\supset\mathbb{S}^m$.
Then it follows that
\[U_{\frac\pi2}=\tilde U_{\frac\pi2}=\mathbb{S}^m.
\leqno({*})\]

Prove that for any $x\in \partial U_r$ we have
\[H_r(x)\ge \tilde H_r,\] 
where $H_r(x)$ denotes the mean curvature of $\partial U_r$  at a point $x$
and $\tilde H_r$ is the mean curvature of $\partial\tilde U_r$.

Set 
\begin{align*}
a(r)&=\vol_{m-1} \partial U_r,
&
\tilde a(r)&=\vol_{m-1} \partial\tilde U_r,
\\
v(r)&=\vol_m U_r,
&
\tilde v(r)&=\vol_m \tilde U_r.
\intertext{by the coarea formula,}
\tfrac d{dr} v(r)&= a(r),
&
\tfrac d{dr}\tilde v(r)&=\tilde a(r).
\end{align*}
for almost all $r$.
Note that
\begin{align*}\tfrac d{dr}a(r)&\le \int\limits_{\partial U_r} H_r(x)\cdot d_x\vol_{m-1}\le
\\
&\le a(r)\cdot \tilde H_r
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
\tfrac d{dr}\tilde a(r)
&= \tilde a(r)\cdot \tilde H_r.
\intertext{It follows that}
\frac {v''(r)}{v(r)}&\le \frac {\tilde v''(r)}{\tilde v(r)}
\end{align*}
for almost all $r$. 
Therefore
\[v(r)\le\frac{\area\Sigma}{\area \mathbb{S}^n}\cdot \tilde v(r)\]

for any $r>0$.

According to $({*})$,
\[v(\tfrac\pi2)=\tilde v(\tfrac\pi2)=\vol\mathbb{S}^m.\]
Whence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
This problem is the most geometric part of the isoperimetric inequality proved by Frederick Almgren in \cite{almgren}.

the proof of Gromov--Levy isometric inequality given by Mikhael Gromov \cite[see][]{gromov-apendix}.

\parbf{\ref{codim=2}.} 
\textit{Hypercurve.}
Fix $p\in M$.
Denote by $s$ 
the second fundamental form of $M$ at $p$;
it is a symmetric bi-linear form on the tangent space $\T_pM$ of $M$ with values in the normal space $\mathrm{N}_pM$ to $M$ [see page~\pageref{Second fundamental form}].
Note that the normal space $\mathrm{N}_pM$ is two-dimensional.

Prove that if the sectional curvature of $M$ is positive, 
then
\[\<s(X,X),s(Y,Y)\> > 0\leqno({*})\]
for any pair of nonzero vectors $X,Y\in\T_pM$.

Show that $({*})$ implies that there is an orthonormal basis $e_1,e_2$ in $\mathrm{N}_pM$ 
such that the real-valued quadratic forms 
\begin{align*}
s_1(X,X)&=\<s(X,X),e_1\>,
&
s_2(X,X)&=\<s(X,X),e_2\>
\end{align*}
are positive definite.

Note that the curvature operators $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
defined by the following identity
\[R_{i}(X\wedge Y), V\wedge W\rangle 
=s_i(X,W)\cdot s_i(Y,V)-s_i(X,V)\cdot s_i(Y,W),\]
 are positive.
Finally, note that $R_{1}+R_{2}$ is the curvature operator of $M$ at $p$.

\parit{Comments.}
The problem is due to Alan Weinstein \cite[see][]{weinstein}.

\textit{Horosphere.}
Set 
$m=\dim \Sigma=\dim M-1$.

Let $b\:M\to\RR$ be the Busemann function such that $\Sigma=b^{-1}(\{0\})$.
Set  $\Sigma_r=b^{-1}(\{r\})$, so $\Sigma_0=\Sigma$.

Let us equip each $\Sigma_r$ with induced Riemannian metric.
Note that all $\Sigma_r$ have bounded curvature.
In particular, the unit ball in $\Sigma_r$ has volume bounded above by a universal constant, say $v_0$.
 

Given $x\in \Sigma$ denote by $\gamma_x$ 
the unit-speed geodesic
such that $\gamma_x(0)=x$ and $b(\gamma_x(t))=t$ for any $t$.
Consider the map $\phi_{r}\:\Sigma\to\Sigma_r$ defined as
$\phi_r\:x\mapsto \gamma_x(r)$.

Notice that $\phi_r$ is a bi-Lipschitz map with the Lipschitz constants $e^{a\cdot r}$ and $e^{b\cdot r}$.
In particular, the ball of radius $R$ in $\Sigma$ is mapped by $\phi_r$
to a ball of radius $e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R$ in $\Sigma_r$.
Therefore
\[\vol_m B(x,R)_\Sigma\le e^{m\cdot b\cdot r}\cdot \vol_m B(x,e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R)_{\Sigma_r}\]
for any $R,r>0$.
Applying this formula in case $e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R=1$ implies that
\[\vol_m B(x,R)_\Sigma\le v_0\cdot R^{m\cdot \frac ba}.\]

\parit{Comments.}
The problem was suggested by Vitali Kapovitch.

There are examples of horospheres as above with degree of polynomial growth higher than $m$.
For example, consider the horosphere $\Sigma$ in the
the complex hyperbolic space 
of real dimension $4$.
Clearly $m=\dim \Sigma=3$, but the degree of its volume growth is $4$.
The latter follows since $\Sigma$ comes with a left-invariant metric on the \hyperref[Heisenberg group]{\emph{Heisenberg group}} (any such metric has volume  growth of degree $4$).

\textit{Minimal spheres.}
Choose a pair of sufficiently close minimal spheres $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$,
say assume that the distance $a$ between $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ is strictly smaller than the injectivity radius of the manifold.
Note that in this case there is a bijection $\Sigma\to \Sigma'$, which will be denoted by $p\mapsto p'$ such that the distance $|p-p'|=a$ for any $p\in\Sigma$.

Let $\iota_p\:\T_p\to\T_{p'}$ be the parallel translation along the (necessary unique) minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $p'$.
Use the hairy ball theorem 
to show that there is a pair $(p,p')$ such that $\iota_p(\T_p\Sigma)=\T_{p'}\Sigma'$.

Consider pairs of unit-speed geodesics $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ 
in $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$  
which start at $p$ and $p'$ correspondingly
and go in the parallel directions, say $\nu$ and $\nu'$. 
Set $\ell_\nu(t)=|\alpha(t)-\alpha'(t)|$.

Use the second variation formula to show that $\ell_\nu''(0)$ has negative average for all tangent directions $\nu$ to $\Sigma$ at $p$. 
In particular $\ell_\nu''(0)<0$ for a pair $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ as above.
It follows that there are points $v\in\Sigma$ near $p$ 
and $v'\in\Sigma'$ near $p'$
such that 
\[|v-v'|<|p-p'|;\]
the latter leads to a contradiction.

\parit{Comments.}
It seems pleasurable that a 
compact 
positively curved 
4-dimensional manifold
cannot contain a pair of equidistant spheres.
The argument above implies that the distance between such a pair has to exceed the injectivity radius of the manifold.

Set $n=\dim N$ and $m=\dim M$.

Fix a smooth increasing concave function $\phi$.
Consider the function $f=\phi\circ\dist_N$.
Note that if $f$ is smooth at $x$ 
the Hessian, $\Hess_xf$, has at least $n+1$ negative eigenvalues.

Moreover, at any point $x\notin \iota(N)$ the same holds in the barrier sense;
that is, there is a smooth function $h\ge f$ defined on $M$
such that $h(x)=f(x)$ and $\Hess_xf$ has at least $n+1$ negative eigenvalues.

Use that $m< 2\cdot n$ and the property to prove the following

{\it Given $x\notin \iota(N)$ there is a neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that the set

\medskip

Since $M$ is simply connected,
any closed curve in $\iota(N)$
can be contracted by a disc, say $f_0\:\mathbb D\to M$.
According to the claim, 
there is a homotopy $f_t\:\mathbb D\to M$, $t\in [0,1]$ 
such that $f_t(\partial \mathbb D)\subset \iota(N)$ for any $t$ and $f_1(\mathbb D)\subset \iota(N)$.
It follows that $\iota(N)$ is simply connected.

Finally note that if $\iota\:N\to M$ has a self-intersection,
then the image
$\iota(N)$ is not simply connected.
Hence the result follows.

Complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $\ge \kappa$ are Alexandrov spaces.

The following statement follows from the one above 
and it can be used directly in the solution.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $(M,g)$ is a Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $\ge 1$ which admits a continuous isometric action of $\mathbb S^1$, 
then $(M,g)/\mathbb S^1$ is an Alexandrov space with curvature $\ge 1$.
\end{itemize}
For more on Alexandrov Geometry, see \cite{akp}. 

\parit{Solution.}
Let $M$ be a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold with isometric $\mathbb{S}^1$-action.
Consider the quotient space $X=M/\mathbb{S}^1$.
Note that $X$ is a positively curved 3-dimensional Alexandrov space.
In particular the angle $\measuredangle\hinge xyz$ between any two geodesics $[xy]$ and $[xz]$ is defined
and for any non-degenerate triangle $[xyz]$ 
formed by the minimizing geodesics $[xy]$, $[yz]$ and $[zx]$  in $X$ we have
\[\measuredangle\hinge xyz+\measuredangle\hinge yzx+\measuredangle\hinge zxy> \pi.
\leqno({*})\]

Assume $p\in X$ corresponds to a fixed point of $\mathbb{S}^1$-action.
Show that 
for any three geodesics $[px]$, $[py]$ and $[pz]$ in $X$ we have
\[\measuredangle\hinge pxy+\measuredangle\hinge pyz+\measuredangle\hinge pzx\le \pi.\leqno({*}{*})\]
and
\[\measuredangle\hinge pxy, \measuredangle\hinge pyz, \measuredangle\hinge pzx\le \tfrac\pi2.\leqno({*}{*}{*})\]

Arguing by contradiction,
assume that there are 4 fixed points $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ and $q_4$.
Connect each pair $q_i\ne q_j$ by a minimizing geodesic $[q_iq_j]$.

Denote by $\omega$ the sum of all 12 angles of the type  $\measuredangle\hinge{q_i}{q_j}{q_k}$.
By $({*}{*}{*})$, each triangle $\triangle q_iq_jq_k$ is non-degenerate.
Therefore by $({*})$, we have
\[\omega>4\cdot\pi.\]
Applying $({*}{*})$ at each vertex $q_i$, we have 
\[\omega\le 4\cdot\pi,\]
a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{Energy minimizer}.} 
\textit{Energy minimizer.}
Denote by $\mathcal{U}$ the unit tangent bundle over $\RP^m$
and $\mathcal{L}$ the space of projective lines in $\ell\:\RP^1\to \RP^m$.
The spaces $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{L}$ 
have dimensions $2\cdot m-1$ 
and $2\cdot(m-1)$
correspondingly.


According to Liouville's theorem, the identity
\[\int\limits_{\mathcal{U}}f(v)\cdot d_v\vol_{2\cdot m-1}
=
\int\limits_{\mathcal{L}}d_\ell\vol_{2\cdot(m-1)}\cdot\int\limits_{\RP^1} f(\ell'(t))\cdot dt\]
holds for any integrable function $f\:\mathcal{U}\to\RR$.

Let $F\:\RP^m\to\RP^m$ be a smooth map.
Note that up to a multiplicative constant,
the energy of $F$ can be expressed the following way
\[\int\limits_{\mathcal{U}} |dF(v)|^2\cdot d_v\vol_{2m-1}
=
\int\limits_{\mathcal{L}}d_\ell\vol_{2\cdot(m-1)}\cdot\int\limits_{\RP^1} |[d(F\circ \ell)](t)|^2\cdot dt.\]

The result follows since
\[\int\limits_{\RP^1} |[d(F\circ \ell)](t)|^2\cdot dt\ge \pi\]
for any line $\ell\:\RP^1\to \RP^m$.

\parit{Comments.} 
The same idea is used to prove Loewner's inequality on the volume in of $\RP^m$ with metric conformally equivalent to the canonical one \cite[see][]{gromov-filling}.

The problem is due to Christopher Croke \cite[see][]{croke-energy}. 
He uses the same idea to show that the identity map on $\CP^m$ is energy minimizing in its homotopy class.
For $\mathbb S^m$, an analogous statement does not hold if $m\ge 3$.
In fact, 
if a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ 
has dimension at least 3 
and $\pi_1M=\pi_2M=0$,
then the identity map on $M$ is homotopic 
to a map with arbitrary small energy;
the latter was shown by Brian White in \cite{white}.

\parbf{\ref{scalar-curv}.} 
\textit{Curvature vs. injectivity radius.}\\
\textit{Prerequisite.}
The solution use a corollary of Liouville's theorem 
which states that geodesic flow on the tangent bundle to a Riemannian manifold preserves the volume form.

\parit{Solution.}
We will show that 
if the injectivity radius of the manifold $(M,g)$ is at least $\pi$,
then the average of sectional curvatures on $(M,g)$ is at most $1$.
This is equivalent to the problem.

Fix a point $p\in M$ and two orthonormal vectors $U,V\in\T_p M$.
Consider the geodesic $\gamma$ in $M$ such that $\dot\gamma(0)=U$.

Set $U_t=\dot\gamma(t)\in \T_{\gamma(t)}$ 
and let $V_t\in \T_{\gamma(t)}$ be the parallel translation of $V=V_0$ along $\gamma$.

Consider the field $W_t=\sin t\cdot V_t$ on $\gamma$.
Set 
\begin{align*}
\gamma_\tau(t)&=\exp_{\gamma(t)} (\tau\cdot W_t),
\\
\ell(\tau)&=\length(\gamma_\tau|_{[0,\pi]}),
\\
q(U,V)&=\ell''(0).
\end{align*}
Note that
$$q(U,V)
=
\int\limits_{0}^\pi [(\cos t)^2-K(U_t,V_t)\cdot (\sin t)^2]\cdot dt,
\leqno({*})$$
where $K(U,V)$ denotes the sectional curvature 
in the direction spanned by $U$ and $V$. 

Since any geodesics of length $\pi$ is minimizing,
we get $q(U,V)\ge0$ for any pair of orthonormal vectors $U$ and $V$.
It follows that average value of the right hand side in $({*})$ is non-negative.

By Liouville's theorem, while taking the average of $({*})$, we can switch the order of integrals;
therefore  
\[0\le \tfrac\pi2\cdot(1-\bar{K}),\]
where $\bar{K}$ denotes the average of sectional curvatures on $(M,g)$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.} Liouville's theorem has a number of similar applications,
one of the most beautiful is the sharp isoperimetric inequality for 
4-dimensional Hadamard manifolds;
it was proved by Christopher Croke in \cite{croke-4d},
see also \cite{croke-eigenvalue}.

\textit{Almost flat manifold.}
First prove that for given $\eps>0$, 
there is big enough $m$ and $m\times m$ integer matrix 
$A$ such that all its eigenvalues are $\eps$-close to $1$. 

Consider $(m+1)$-dimensional manifold $S$ obtained from $\TT^m\times [0,1]$ by gluing $\TT^m\times 0$ to $\TT^m\times 1$ along the map given by $A$.

Assuming that $\eps$ is small,
show that $S$ admits a metric with curvature and diameter sufficiently small.

\parit{Comments.} 
This example was constructed 
by Galina Guzhvina in \cite{guzhvina}.

The main theorem of Gromov in \cite{gromov-almost-flat}, 
states that there are no such examples of fixed dimension;
a more detailed proof can be found in \cite{buser-karcher}
and a more precise statement can be found in \cite{ruh}.

It is expected that for small enough $\eps>0$,
a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of any dimension 
with  $\diam(M,g)\le 1$ and $|K_g|\le \eps$ cannot be simply connected,
here $K_g$ denotes the sectional curvature of $g$.
It is not true if instead one asks only have $K_g\le \eps$;
in fact, 
for any $\eps>0$,
there are metrics $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^3$ 
with $K_g\le \eps$ and $\diam(\mathbb{S}^3,g)\le 1$; 
this example was originally constructed by Mikhael Gromov in \cite{gromov-almost-flat}; 
a simplified proof was given by 
Peter Buser
and Detlef Gromoll in \cite{buser-gromoll}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{lie-nonneg}.} 
\textit{Lie group.} We will write the metrics in contrvariant form, 
so metric $g$ is considered to be a linear transformation $\T\to \T^*$ and 
\[|v|_g=\sqrt{[g^{-1}(v)](v)}\]
for any tangent vector $v$.


Let $G$ be the compact Lie group and $e\in G$ is the identity element.

Denote by $K$ the set of all contrvariant metrics $g\:\T^*_e\to \T_e $ 
which extend to non-negatively curved left invariant metrics $\tilde g$ on $G$. 

First recall that the bi-invariant metric on a compact Lie groups is non-negatively curved. 
Therefore $K$ is non empty.

We will show that $K$ is convex, this is stronger than required.
That is, 
we need to show that if $g_0, g_1\in K$,
then 
\[g_t=(1-t)\cdot g_0+t\cdot g_1\in K\] 
for any $t\in [0,1]$.

Denote by $\Delta$ the diagonal subgroup of $G\times G$.

For each $t\in (0,1)$, consider the product 
\[(G\times G,\tilde h_t)
=
(G,(1-t)\cdot \tilde g_0)\times (G,t\cdot \tilde g_1).\]
Note that $h_t$ is non-negatively curved left invariant metric on $G\times G$.

The quotient map 
\[
 (G\times G,\tilde h_t)\to (G\times G,\tilde h_t)/\Delta
\]
is a Riemannian submersion.
By O'Nail's formula,
the target has non-negative curvature.

Finally note that $(G,\tilde g_t)$
is isometric to
$(G\times G,\tilde h_t)/\Delta$ for any $t\in (0,1)$.
Therefore $g_t\in K$ for any $t\in [0,1]$ as required.

\parit{Comments.}
The earliest use of this construction 
I found  in \cite{GKM}.
It was used to show that Berger's spheres have positive curvature;
it was done by showing that
Berger's spheres are isometric to the quotient space $(\mathbb S^3\times \RR)/\RR$ for certain $\RR$-actions which shifts $\RR$ and rotates $\mathbb{S}^3$ at the same time.

This construction some times is called \emph{Cheeger's trick}.
It is used to construct most of the examples of positively and non-negatively curved manifolds
 \cite[see][]{cheeger,aloff-wallach,gromoll-meyer,eschenburg-spaces,bazajkin}.

\parbf{\ref{Isometric section}.} 
\textit{Isometric section.}
Arguing by contradiction, 
assume $\iota\: M\z\to W$ is an isometric section.
It makes possible to treat $M$ as a submanifold in $W$.

Given $p\in M$,
denote by $\nu_pM$ the sphere of unit normal vectors to $M$ at $p$.
Given $v\in \nu_p$ and real value $k$,
set 
\[p^{k\cdot v}=s\circ\exp_{p} (k\cdot v).\]
Note that 
\[p^{0\cdot v}=p\ \ \text{for any}\ \  p\in M\ \ \text{and}\ \ v\in \nu_p.\leqno({*})\]

Fix sufficiently small $\delta>0$.
By Rauch comparison, 
if $w\in \nu_q$ 
is the parallel translation of $v\in \nu_q$ 
along a minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$ in $M$,
then 
\[|p^{k\cdot v}-q^{k\cdot w}|_M<|p-q|_M
\leqno({*}{*})\]
assuming $|k|\le \delta$.
The same comparison implies that 
\[|p^{k\cdot v}-q^{k'\cdot w}|_M^2<|p-q|_M^2+ (k-k')^2
\leqno({*}{*}{*})\]
assuming $|k|,|k'|\le \delta$.

Choose $p$ and $v \in \nu_p$ so that $r=|p-p^{\delta\cdot v}|$ 
takes the maximal possible value.
From $({*}{*})$ it follows that $r>0$.

Let $\gamma$ be the extension of the unit-speed minimizing geodesic from $p_v$ to $p$;
denote by $v_t$ the parallel translation of $v$ to $\gamma(t)$ along $\gamma$. 

We can choose the parameter of $\gamma$ so that $p=\gamma(0)$, $p^v=\gamma(-r)$.
Set $p_n=\gamma(n\cdot r)$, so $p=p_0$ and $p^v=p_{-1}$. 
Fix large integer $N$ and set $w_n=(1-\tfrac nN)\cdot v_{n\cdot r}$
and $q_n=p_n^{w_n}$.

From $({*}{*}{*})$, there is a constant $C$ independent of $N$ such that

Therefore 
\[|q_{k+1}-p_{k+1}|>|q_k-p_k|-\tfrac C{N^2}\cdot\delta^2.\]
By induction, we get 
\[|q_N-p_N|>r-\tfrac C{N}\cdot\delta^2.\]
Since $N$ is large we get
\[|q_N-p_N|>0.\]
By $({*})$ we get $q_N=p_N^0=p_N$, a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{Warped product}.} 
\textit{Warped product.}
Given $x\in \Sigma$, denote by $\nu_x$ the normal vector to $\Sigma$ at $x$ which agrees with the orientations of $\Sigma$ and $M$.
Denote by $\kappa_x$ the non-negative principle curvature of $\Sigma$ at $x$;
since $\Sigma$ is minimal the other principle curvature has to be $-\kappa_x$.

Consider the warped product $W=\mathbb S^1\times_f\Sigma$ for some positive smooth function $f\:\Sigma\to \RR$.
Assume that a point $y\in W$ projects to a point $x\in\Sigma$.
Straightforward computations show that
\begin{align*}
\Sc_W(y)
&=\Sc_\Sigma(x)-2\cdot\frac{\Delta f(x)}{f(x)}=
\\
&=\Sc_M(x)-2\cdot\Ric(\nu_x)-2\cdot\kappa_x^2-2\cdot\frac{\Delta f(x)}{f(x)}.
\end{align*}
Consider linear operator $L$ on the space of smooth functions on $\Sigma$ defined as 
\[(Lf)(x)= -[\Ric(\nu_x)+\kappa_x^2]\cdot f(x)-(\Delta f)(x)\]
It is sufficient to find a smooth function $f$ on $\Sigma$ such that
\[f(x)>0 \ \ \text{and}\ \ (Lf)(x)\ge 0\leqno({*})\]
for any $x\in \Sigma$.


Fix a smooth function $f\:\Sigma\to \RR$.
Extend the field $f(x)\cdot\nu_x$
on $\Sigma$ to a smooth field, say $v$, on whole $M$.
Denote by $\iota_t$ the flow along $v$ for time $t$ and set $\Sigma_t=\iota_t(\Sigma)$.

\parit{Informal end of proof.}
Denote by $H_t(x)$ the mean curvature of $\Sigma_t$ at $\iota_t(x)$.
Note that the value $(Lf)(x)$ is the derivative of
the function $t\mapsto H_t(x)$  at $t=0$.

Therefore the condition $({*})$
means that we can push $\Sigma$ into one of its sides 
so that its mean curvature does not increase in the first order.
Since $\Sigma$ is area minimizing,
the existence of such push should be evident;
read further if this is not the case.

\parit{Formal end of proof.}
Denote by $\delta(f)$ the second variation of area of $\Sigma_t$;
that is consider the area function $a(t)=\area\Sigma_t$ 
and set $\delta(f)=a''(0)$.
Direct calculations show that
\begin{align*}
\delta(f)
&=
\int\limits_{\Sigma} 
\left(-[\Ric(\nu_x)+\kappa_x^2]\cdot f^2(x)+|\nabla f(x)|^2\right)\cdot d_x\area=
\\
&=\int\limits_{\Sigma} 
(Lf)(x)\cdot f(x)\cdot d_x\area.\end{align*}
Since $\Sigma$ is area minimizing we get 
\[\delta(f)\ge 0\leqno({*}{*})\] for any $f$.

Choose a function $f$ which minimize $\delta(f)$ among all the functions such that $\int_\Sigma f^2(x)\cdot d_x\area=1$.
Note that $f$ an eigenfunction 
for the linear operator $L$;
in particular $f$ is smooth.
Denote by $\lambda$ the eigenvalue of $f$;
by $({*}{*})$,
$\lambda\ge 0$.

Show that $f(x)>0$ at any $x$.
Since $Lf=\lambda\cdot f$, the inequalities $({*})$ follow.





\parit{Comments.}
The problem is due to Mikhael Gromov and Blaine Lawson \cite[see][]{gromov-lawson}.
Earlier, Shing-Tung  Yau and Richard Schoen showed that the same assumptions 
imply existence of conformal factor on $\Sigma$ which makes it positively curved.
Both statement are used 
to proof that $\TT^3$ does not admit a metric with positive scalar curvature;
the original proof is given in \cite{schoen-yau}.

Both statements admit straightforward generalization to higher dimensions
and they can be used to show non existence metric with positive scalar curvature on $\TT^m$ with $m\le 7$.
For $m=8$, the proof stops to work 
since in this dimension the area minimizing hypersurfaces might have singularities.
For example, 
any domain in the cone in $\RR^8$
defined by the identity
\[x^2_1+x^2_2+x^2_3+x^2_4=x^2_5+x^2_6+x^2_7+x^2_8\]
is area minimizing among the hypersurfaces with the same boundary.

Fix an increasing function $\phi\:(0,r)\to \RR$

\[\phi''+(n-1)\cdot(\phi')^2+C=0.\]

Note that if $\Ric_{g_n}\ge C$, 
then the function 
$x\mapsto\phi(|p-x|_{g_n})$ is subharmonic.
In follows that, 
for arbitrary array of points $p_i$ 
and positive reals $\lambda_i$ the function $f_n\:M_n\to \RR$
defined by the formula
$$f(x)=\sum_i\lambda_i\cdot\phi(|p_i-x|_M)$$
is subharmonic.
In particular $f_n$ cannot admit a local minima in $M_n$.

Passing the limit as $n\to \infty$, we get that any function $f\:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}$
of the form 
$$f(x)=\sum_i\lambda_i\cdot\phi(|p_i-x|_{\ell_p})$$
does not admit a local minima in $\mathbb{R}^m$.

Arrive to a contradiction
by showing that if $p\ne 2$,
then there is an array
points $p_i$ and positive reals $\lambda_i$
such that the function 
$$f(x)=\sum_i\lambda_i\cdot\phi(|p_i-x|_{\ell_p})$$
has strict local minimum.

\parit{Comment.} The argument given here is very close to the proof of Abresch--Gromoll inequality in \cite{abresch-gromoll}.
An alternative solution of this problem can be build on almost splitting theorem proved by  Jeff Cheeger and Tobias Colding in \cite{cheeger-colding}.

where $C_m$ is a constant depending only on the dimension $m=\dim M$,

Further, note that such metric can be constructed in such a way that it has a closed geodesic $\gamma$ with trivial holonomy and with constant negative curvature in its a tubular neighborhood.

Cut the tubular neighborhood $D^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$ of $\gamma$, 
prepare a metric $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^1\times D^2$ with negative scalar curvature which

The needed patch $(\mathbb{S}^1\times D^2,g)$ can be found among wrap products $\mathbb{S}^1\times_f D^2$.

Note that after the surgery we get a manifold diffeomorphic to $\RR^3$ with the required metric.

to the origin.

Prove that the angles of the triangle $\triangle abc$
coincide with its model angles.
It follows that there is a flat geodesic triangle in $(\RR^3,g)$ with vertex at $a$, $b$ and $c$.

Use the family of constructed flat triangles 
to show that at any $x$ point in the $\tfrac\eps{10}$-neighborhood of the origin
the sectional curvature 
vanish in an open set of sectional directions.
The latter implies that the curvature is identically zero 
in this neighborhood.

Moving the origin and apply the same argument we get that the curvature is identically zero everywhere.
Hence the result follows.

Let us equip $\RR^4$ with $(x,y,z,t)$-coordinates.

Consider a generic linear function $\ell\:\RR^4\to\RR$
which is close to the sum of coordinates $x+y+z+t$.
Note that $\ell$
has non-degenerate critical points on $W$ and all its critical values are different.

Consider the sets 
$$W_s=\set{w\in \RR^4\backslash K}{\ell(w)<s}.$$
Note that $W_{-1000}$ contains a closed curve, say $\alpha$, 
which is contactable in $\RR^4\backslash K$, 
but not constructable in the set $W_{-1000}$.

Set $s_0$ to be the infimum of the values $s$ such that
the $\alpha$ is contactable in $W_s$.

Note that $s_0$ is a critical value of $\ell$ on $W$;
denote by $p_0$ the corresponding critical point.
By 2-convexity of $\RR^4\backslash K$,
the index of $p_0$ has to be at most $1$.
On the other hand, since the disc hangs at this point,
its index has to be at least $2$,
 a contradiction.

\parit{Alexandrov-style proof.}
Fix a constant Riemannian metric $g$ on $\RR^4$.
According to the main result of Alexander Bishop and Berg in \cite{ABB}, $X_g=(\RR^4\backslash (\Int K),g)$ has non-positive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
In particular the universal cover of $\tilde X_g$ of $X_g$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space.

By rescaling $g$ and passing to the limit we obtain that universal Riemannian cover $Z_g$ of $(\RR^4,g)$ branching in the coordinate planes is a $\CAT[0]$ space.
Show that $Z_g$ is $\CAT[0]$ space if and only if the two planes are orthogonal with respect to $g$;
the latter leads to a contradiction.

\parit{Comments.}
Note that the closed $1$-neighborhood of these two planes has two-convex complement, but the boundary of this neighborhood is not smooth.

The Morse-style is based on the idea of Mikhael Gromov \cite[see][\S\textonehalf]{gromov-SGMC}.

 introduced by Mikhael Gromov in \cite{gromov-pseudoholomorphic}.

\parit{Solution.}
First show that there is a self-dual harmonic 2-form on $(\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2,g)$;
that is, a 2-form $\omega$ such that $d\omega=0$ and $\star\omega=\omega$,
where $\star$ denotes the Hodge star operator.

Fix $p\in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.
Use the identity $\star\omega_p=\omega_p$
to show that
there is a real number $\lambda_p$ and the isometry $\mathrm{J}_p\:\T_p\to\T_p$ 
such that
$\mathrm{J}_p\circ\mathrm{J}_p =-\id$ 
and 
$\omega(X,Y)=\lambda_p\cdot g(X,\mathrm{J}_pY)$ for any $X,Y\in \T_p$.

Consider canonical symplectic form $\omega_0$ on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$;
that is sum of pullbacks of volume forms on $\mathbb{S}^2$  
for the two projections $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$.
Note that for the canonical metric on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$,
the form $\omega_0$ is harmonic and self-dual. 
Since $g$ is close to the standard metric,
we can assume that $\omega$ is close to $\omega_0$.
In particular $\lambda_p\ne0$ for any $p\in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.

It follows that $\omega$ defines symplectic structure on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$
and $\mathrm{J}$ is its pseudo-complex structure.
It remains to take the re-parametrization of $\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2$
so that vertical and horizontal spheres will form pseudo-holomorphic curves in the homology classes of $\mathbb{S}^2\times x$ and $x\times \mathbb{S}^2$.
 
\parit{Comments.} 
For general metric the form $\omega$ might vanish at some points;
if the metric is generic,
then it happens on disjoint circles \cite[see][]{honda}.

\parbf{\ref{Volume and convexity}.} 
\textit{Volume and convexity.}\\
\textit{Prerequisite.}
The solution use a corollary from Liouville's theorem 
which states that geodesic flow on the tangent bundle to a Riemannian manifold preserves the volume form.

\parit{Solution.}
Assume the contrary; that is, there is a complete Riemannian manifold $M$
with finite volume which admits a convex function $f$.

Denote by $\tau\:\UU M\to M$ the unit tangent bundle over $M$. 
Clearly $\vol (\UU M)$ is finite.

Note that 
there is a nonempty bounded open set $\Omega\subset \UU M$
such that $df(u)>\eps$ for any $u\in \Omega$ and some fixed $\eps>0$.

Denote by $\phi^t$ the geodesic flow on $\UU M$.
By Liouville's theorem 
\[\vol[\phi^t(\Omega)]=\vol\Omega\] 
for any $t$.

Given $u\in \Omega$,
consider the function $h\:t\mapsto f\circ\tau\circ\phi^t(u)$.
Note that $h'(t)>\eps$ for any $t\ge 0$.
It follows that there is an infinite sequence of positive reals $t_1,t_2,\dots$
such that 
$$\phi^{t_i}(\Omega)\cap\phi^{t_j}(\Omega)=\emptyset$$ 
if $i\ne j$.
The latter implies that $\vol \UU M=\infty$,
a contradiction.

\parit{Comments.} The idea in the proof is essentially 
Poincar\'e recurrence theorem.

The problem is due 
to Richard Bishop and Barrett O'Neill \cite[see][]{bishop-oneill},
it was generalized by
Shing-Tung Yau  in \cite{yau}.

Set

Consider functions $f_i\:[0,1]^m\to\RR$ defined by
$f_i(x)=\dist_{A_i}x$.
Note that 
the map $\bm{f}\:([0,1]^m,g)\to\RR^m$
defined as
\[\bm{f}\:x\mapsto(f_1(x),f_2(x),\dots,f_m(x))\]
is Lipschitz.

Prove that Jacobian of  $\bm{f}$
is at most $1$
and $\bm{f}([0,1]^m)\supset [0,1]^m$.
Hence the result follows.

It remains to do the equality case.

\parit{Comments.} 
The inequality was proved by Abram Besikovitch in \cite{besicovitch}.
It has number applications in Riemannian geometry.
For example using this inequality it is easy to solve the following problem.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Assume a metric $g$ on $\RR^m$ coincides with Euclidean outside of a bounded set $K$;
assume further that any geodesic which comes into $K$ goes out from $K$ the same way as if the metric would be Euclidean everywhere.

there is a path 
$\gamma\:[0,1]\to\mathbb{S}^2$ from $p$ to $q$
such that 
\[\length \gamma\le \ell\] 
and
$w$ is the parallel transformation of $v$ along $\gamma$.

Note that once it is proved, 
it follows that diameter of the set of all vectors of fixed length in $\T \mathbb{S}^2$ has diameter at most $\ell$;
in particular the map $\T\mathbb{S}^2\to[0,\infty)$ defined as $v\mapsto |v|$ 
preserves the distance with the maximal error $\ell$.
Hence the result follows.

$$|\iota(x)-x|\ge 1$$

An example of $D$ can be guessed from the picture. 

Take the product $D\times D\subset \RR^4$;
it is homeomorphic to the 4-ball.
Note that 
$$\vol_3[\partial(D\times D)]=2\cdot\area D\cdot\length \partial D<20\cdot\eps.$$
The boundary $\partial(D\times D)$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^3$
and the restriction of the involution $(x,y)\mapsto (\iota(x),\iota(y))$ has the needed property.

It remains to smooth $\partial(D\times D)$.

\parit{Comments.}
This example is given by Christopher Croke in \cite{croke}.

It is instructive to show that for $\mathbb{S}^2$ such thing is not possible.

Note that according to systolic inequality,

Show that given $R>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that 
if $x\in N$ and $|p-x|_M<R$, 
then there is a unit speed curve in $N$

Following this curve for sufficient time brings us to $p$;

\textit{Symplectic squeezing in the torus.}
Equip $\RR^4$ with $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)$-coordinates
so that 
\[\omega=dx_1\wedge dy_1+dx_2\wedge dy_2\]
is the symplectic form. 

The embedding will be given as a composition of a linear symplectomorphism $\lambda$ 
with the quotient map $\phi\:\RR^4\to \TT^2\times\RR^2$ by the integer $(x_1,y_1)$-lattice.
Clearly $\phi\circ\lambda$ preserves the symplectic structure,
it remains to find $\lambda$ such that the restriction $\phi\circ\lambda|_\Omega$
is injective.

Without loss of generality,
we can assume that $\Omega$ is a ball centered at the origin.
Choose an oriented 2-dimensional subspace $V$ subspace of $\RR^4$ 
such that the integral of $\omega$ over 
$\Omega\cap V$ is small positive number, say $\tfrac\pi4$. 

Note that there is a linear symplectomorphism $\lambda$
 which maps planes parallel to $V$ to planes
parallel to the $(x_1,y_1)$-plane, 
and that maps the disk $V\cap\Omega$ to a disk.
It follows that the the intersection of $\lambda(\Omega)$ 
with any plane parallel to the $(x_1,y_1)$-plane is a disk of radius at most $\tfrac 12$.
In particular $\phi\circ\lambda|_\Omega$
is injective.

\parit{Comments.}
This construction is given 
by Larry Guth in \cite{guth-symplectic}

Note that according to the Gromov's non-squeezing theorem in \cite{gromov-pseudoholomorphic}, 
an analogous statement with $\CC\times \DD$ as the target does not hold, here $\DD\subset \CC$ is the open disc with the induced symplectic structure.
In particular, it shows that
the projection of $\lambda(\Omega)$ as above

\textit{Volume of tubular neighborhoods.}
Let us denote by $\mathrm{N} M$ and $\T M$ the normal and tangent bundle of $M$ in $\RR^m$.

Consider the the normal exponential map $\exp_M\:\mathrm{N} M\to\RR^m$
and denote by $J_V$ its Jacobian at $V\in \mathrm{N}_pM$.
Note that for all small $\eps>0$, we have
\[\vol B_\eps(M)=\int\limits_M d_p\vol_m\cdot\int\limits_{B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_pM}}J_V\cdot d_V\vol_{n-m}.\leqno{({*})}\]

Set $m=\dim M$.
Given $p\in M$, 
denote by $s_p\:\T_p\times \T_p\to \mathrm{N}_p$
the \hyperref[Second fundamental form]{\emph{second fundamental form}} of $M$.
Recall that the curvature tensor of $M$ at $p$ can be expressed the following way
\[R_p(X\wedge Y), V\wedge W\rangle 
=\langle s_p(X,W), s_p(Y,V)\rangle-\langle s_p(X,V), s_p(Y,W)\rangle.\]

Given $V\in \mathrm{N}_p M$,
express $J_V$ in terms of $\<s_p(X,Y),V\>$.
Show that for small $r$ the integral
\[v(r)=\int\limits_{B(0,r)_{\mathrm{N}_pM}}J_V\cdot d_V\vol_{n-m}\]
is a polynomial 
of $r$ and its coefficients can be expressed in terms of the curvature tensor $R_p$.

It follows that the right hand side in $({*})$ can be expressed in terms of curvature tensor of $M$.
The problem follows since the curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of metric tensor of $M$.

\textit{Disc.}
Show that given a positive integer $n$ one can construct a tree $T$ embedded into the disc such that any homotopy of the boundary of the disc to a point pass through a curve which intersects $n$ different edges.
(For the tree on the diagram $n=3$.)

Fix small $\eps>0$, say $\eps=\tfrac1{10}$.
Consider the disc with embedded tree $T$ as above.
We will construct a metric on the disc 
with diameter and length of its boundary below $1$
such that 
the distance between any two edges of $T$ of without common vertex 
is at least $\eps$.

To construct such a metric, 
fix a metric on the cylinder $\mathbb S^1\times [0,1]$ such that

}

\begin{itemize}
\item The $\eps$-neighborhoods of the boundary components 
have product metrics.
\item Any vertical segment $x\times[0,1]$ has length $\tfrac 12$.
\item One of the boundary component has length $\eps$.
\item The other boundary component has length $2\cdot m\cdot \eps$, 
where $m$ is the number of edges in $T$.
\end{itemize}
Equip $T$ with a length-metric so that each edge has length $\eps$
and glue the long boundary component of the cylinder to $T$ by piecewise isometry so that the resulting space is homeomorphic to disc and the tree corresponds to it-self.



According to the first construction,
for any null-homotopy of the boundary 
the least length is at least $n\cdot\tfrac{\eps}{10}$.
The obtained metric is not Riemannian, but is easy to smooth.
Since $n$ is arbitrary the result follows.

\parbf{\ref{short-homotopy}.} 
\textit{Shortening homotopy.}
Set 
\[p=\gamma_0(0)\ \ \text{and}\ \  \ell_0=\length\gamma_0.\]

By compactness argument,
there exists $\delta>0$ 
such that no geodesic loops based at $p$ with has length in the interval $(L-D, L+D+\delta]$. 

Assume $\ell_0\ge L+\delta$.
Choose $t_0\in [0,1]$ such that
\[\length\left(\gamma_0|_{[0,t_0]}\right)=L+\delta\]
Let $\sigma$ be a the minimizing geodesic from $\gamma(t_0)$
to $p$.
Note that $\gamma_0$ is homotopic to the joint 
\[\gamma_0'=\gamma_0|_{[0,t_0]}*\sigma*\bar\sigma*\gamma|_{[t_0,1]},\]
where $\bar\sigma$ denotes the backward parametrization of $\sigma$.

Consider the loop $\lambda_0$ at $p$
formed by joint of $\gamma|_{[0,t_0]}$ and $\sigma$.
Applying a curve shortening process to $\lambda_0$, 
we get a curve shortening homotopy $\lambda_t$
rel. its ends 
from the loop $\lambda_0$ to a geodesic loop $\lambda_1$ at $p$.
From above, 
\[\length\lambda_1\le L-D.\]

The joint $\gamma_t=\lambda_t*\bar\sigma*\gamma|_{[t_0,1]}$
is a homotopy
from $\gamma_0'$ to an other curve $\gamma_1$.
From the construction it is clear that 
\begin{align*}
 \length \gamma_t&\le \length \gamma_0+2\cdot \length\sigma\le
 \\
 &\le \length \gamma_0+2\cdot D
\end{align*}
for any $t\in[0,1]$
and 
\begin{align*}
 \length \gamma_1&=\length\lambda_1+\length\sigma+\length\gamma|_{[t_0,1]}\le
\\ &\le L-D+D+\length\gamma-(L+\delta)=
\\ &=\ell_0 -\delta.
\end{align*}
Repeating the procedure few times we get we get curves $\gamma_2$, $\gamma_3,\dots,\gamma_n$
joint by the needed homotopies so that 
$\ell_{i+1}\le\ell_i-\delta$ and $\ell_n< L+\delta$,
where $\ell_i=\length\gamma_i$.

If $\ell_n\le L$, we are done.
Otherwise repeat the argument once more for $\delta'=\ell_n-L$.

\textit{Convex hypersurface.}
Let $h$ be the maximal distance from points in $W$ to $M$.

Fix a fine triangulation of $W$ 
so that $M$ becomes a sub-complex.
Say, let us assume that the diameter of each simplex in $\tau$ is less than 
$\eps$.
We can assume that $\tau$ is a barycentric subdivision of an other triangulation, so all the vertices of $\tau$ can be colored into colors $(0,\dots, m+1)$
in such a way that the vertices of each simplex 
get different colors.
Denote by $\tau_i$ the maximal $i$-dimensional sub-complex of $\tau$ 
with all the vertices colored by $0,\dots, i$.

For each vertex $v$ in $\tau$ 
choose a point $v'\in M$ on the distance $\le h$.
Note that 
if $v$ and $w$ are the vertices of one simplex,
then
\[|v'-w'|_M<2\cdot h+\eps.\]

If $\tfrac{1}{2\cdot(m+1)}>h$, take $\eps<\tfrac{1}{2\cdot(m+1)}-h$.
Let us extend the map $v\mapsto v'$ 
to a continuous 
map $W\to M$.
The map is already defined on $\tau_0$.
Using the cone construction we can extend it to $\tau_1$;
we can do this since the distance between vertices in one simplex are below injectivity radius of $M$.
Repeat the cone construction recursively, to extend the map to $\tau_2,\dots,\tau_{m+1}=\tau$;
some distance estimates are needed here.

It follows that fundamental class of $M$ vanish in the homology ring of $M$, 
a contradiction.

with respect to the uniform distribution.

Observe that $\delta_m\to 0$ as $m\to\infty$.

Equip the unit tangent bundle $\UU M$ of $M$ with the natural probability measure.
Since $f$ is $1$-Lipschitz,
for a random vector $v$ in $\UU M$,
the  expected value of $|df(w)|$
is at most $\delta_m$.

Note that 
\begin{align*}
|f\circ \gamma(1)-f\circ\gamma(0)|
&=
\left|\int\limits_0^1df(\dot\gamma(t))\cdot dt\right|\le \\
&\le \int\limits_0^1\left|df(\dot\gamma(t))\right|\cdot dt.
\end{align*}

Assume $\dot\gamma(0)$
takes random value in $\UU M$.
By Liouville's theorem, the same holds for $\dot\gamma(t)$
for any fixed $t$.
Therefore
the expected value of
\[\int\limits_0^1|df(\dot\gamma(t))|\cdot dt\]
is at most $\delta_m$.

By Markov's inequality,
the probability of the event 
\[|f\circ \gamma(1)-f\circ\gamma(0)|>\eps\]
is at most $\tfrac{\delta_m}{\eps}$.
Hence the result follows.

The one parameter family of metrics $g_t$

In order to keep the bounds on the curvature and injectivity radius,
the functions $a$ and $b$
suppose to take huge values in the middle of interval.

To prove the second part of theorem, notice that if such metric would not exist,

\textit{Non-contracting map.}
Given any pair of point $x_0,y_0\in K$, 
consider two sequences $x_0,x_1,\dots$ and $y_0,y_1,\dots$
such that 
and $x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$ and $y_{n+1}=f(y_n)$ for each $n$.

Since $K$ is compact, 
we can choose an increasing sequence of integers $n_k$
such that both sequences $(x_{n_i})_{i=1}^\infty$ and $(y_{n_i})_{i=1}^\infty$
converge.
In particular, both of these sequences  are Cauchy;
that is,
\[
|x_{n_i}-x_{n_j}|_K, |y_{n_i}-y_{n_j}|_K\to 0
\ \ 
\text{as}
\ \ \min\{i,j\}\to\infty.
\]


Since $f$ is non-contracting, we get
\[
|x_0-x_{|n_i-n_j|}|
\le 
|x_{n_i}-x_{n_j}|.
\]

It follows that  
there is a sequence $m_i\to\infty$ such that
\[
x_{m_i}\to x\ \ \text{and}\ \ y_{m_i}\to y\ \ \text{as}\ \ i\to\infty.
\leqno({*})\]

Set \[\ell_n=|x_n-y_n|_K,\]
where $|{*}-{*}|_K$ denotes the distance between points in $K$.
Since $f$ is non-contracting, $(\ell_n)$ is a non-decreasing sequence.

By $({*})$, it follows that $\ell_{m_i}\to\ell_0$ as $m_i\to\infty$.
It follows that $(\ell_n)$ is a constant sequence.

In particular 
\[|x_0-y_0|_K=\ell_0=\ell_1=|f(x_0)-f(y_0)|_K\]
for any pair of points $(x_0,y_0)$ in $K$.
That is, $f$ is distance preserving, in particular injective.

From $({*})$, we also get that $f(K)$ is everywhere dense.
Since $K$ is compact $f\:K\to K$ is surjective. Hence the result follows.

This construction is a stripped version of theorem proved by Steven Ferry and Boris Okunin in \cite{ferry-okun}.
The theorem states that Riemannian metrics on a smooth closed manifold $M$ with $\dim M\ge 3$ 
can approximate given compact length-metric space $X$ 
if and only if 
there is a continuous map $M\to X$
which is surjective on the fundamental groups. 

The two-dimensional case is quite different.
There is no sequence of Riemannian metrics on
$\mathbb{S}^2$ which converge in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology to the unit disc.
In fact, 
if $X$ is a Gromov--Hausdorff limit of $(\mathbb{S}^2,g_n)$,
then any point $x_0\in X$ either admits a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\RR^2$ or it is a cut point;
that is $X\backslash\{x_0\}$ is disconnected \cite[see][3.32]{gromov-MetStr}.

\textit{Macro-dimension.}
Choose a point $p\in M$,
denote by $f$ the distance function from $p$.

Let us cover $M$ by the connected components of the inverse images 
$f^{-1}((n-1,n+1))$.
Clearly any point in $M$ is covered by at most two such components.
It remains to show that each of these components has diameter less than $100$.

Assume the contrary; let $x$ and $y$ be two points in such connected component 
and $|x-y|_M\ge 100$.
Connect $x$ to $y$ by a curve $\tau$ in the component.
Consider the closed curve $\sigma$ formed by two geodesics $[px]$, $[py]$ and $\tau$.

Prove that $\sigma$ can be divided into 4 arcs $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$
in such a way that the minimal distance from $\alpha$ to $\gamma$ as well as the minimal distance from $\beta$ to $\delta$ is at least $10$.

Use the last statement to show that $\sigma$ 
cannot be shrank 
by a disc it its $1$-neighborhood;
the latter contradicts the assumption.

\parbf{\ref{weird-metric}.} 
\textit{No short embedding.}
Consider a chain of disjoint circles $c_0,\dots,c_n$ in $\RR^3$;
that is, $c_i$ and $c_{i-1}$ are linked for each $i$. 


\begin{center}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/chain(1)}
\lbl[t]{5,0;$c_0$}
\lbl[t]{11,0;$c_1$}
\lbl[t]{31,0;$\cdots$}
\lbl[t]{54,0;$c_n$}
\end{lpic}
\end{center}


Assume that $\RR^3$ is equipped with a length-metric $\rho$,
such that the total length of the circles is $\ell$
and $U$ is an open set containing all the circles $c_i$.
Note that for any short homeomorphism $f\:(U,\rho)\to\RR^3$ the distance from $f(c_0)$ to $f(c_n)$ is less than $\ell$.

Let us show that the $\rho$-distance from $c_0$ to $c_n$ might be much larger than $\ell$.
Fix a line segment $[ab]$ in $\RR^3$.
Modify 
the length-metric on $\RR^3$ in arbitrary small neighborhood of $[ab]$
so that there is a chain $(c_i)$ of circles as above,
which goes from $a$ to $b$ 
such that
(1) the total length, say $\ell$, 
of $(c_i)$ is arbitrary small,
but 
(2) the obtained metric $\rho$ 
is arbitrary close to the canonical, say
\[\bigl|\rho(x,y)-|x-y|\bigr|<\eps\]
for any two points $x,y\in\RR^3$
and fixed in advanced small $\eps>0$.
The construction of $\rho$ 
is done by shrinking the length of each circle
and expanding the length in the normal directions  
to the circles in their small neighborhood.
The latter is made in order to make impossible to use the circles $c_i$ as a shortcut;
that is, one spends more time to go from one circle to an other 
than saves on going along the circle.

Set $a_n=(0,\tfrac1n,0)$ and $b_n=(1,\tfrac1n,0)$.
Note that the line segments $[a_nb_n]$ are disjoint and converging
to $[a_\infty b_\infty]$
where $a_\infty=(0,0,0)$ and $b_\infty=(1,0,0)$.

Apply the above construction in non-overlapping convex neighborhoods of $[a_nb_n]$ 
and for a sequences 
$\eps_n$ and $\ell_n$ 
which converge to zero very fast.

The obtained length-metric $\rho$ is still close to the canonical,
but for any open set $U$ containing $[a_\infty b_\infty]$
the space $(U,\rho)$ does not admit 
a short homeomorphism to $\RR^3$.
Indeed, 
if such homeomorphism $h$ exists, 
then 
from the above construction,
we get 
\begin{align*}
|h(a_\infty)-f(b_\infty)|
&\le 
|h(a_n)-f(b_n)|
+
\\
&\ \ \ \ \ +
|h(a_\infty)-f(a_n)|
+
|h(b_n)-f(b_\infty)|
\le
\\
&\le
\ell_n+\tfrac2n+100\cdot\eps_n.
\end{align*}
The right hand side converges to $0$ as $n\to\infty$.
Therefore 
\[h(a_\infty)=f(b_\infty),\] 
a contradiction.

It remains to performs similar construction countably many times so a bad segment as $[a_\infty b_\infty]$ above
appears in any open set of $\RR^3$.

\parbf{\ref{sub-Riemannian}.} 
\textit{Sub-Riemannian sphere.}\\
\textit{Prerequisite.}
It will be hard to solve the problem without knowing proof of Nash--Kuiper theorem on length preserving $C^1$-embeddings.
The original papers of John Nash 
and Nicolaas Kuiper \cite[see][]{nash,kuiper} are very readable.

\parit{Solution.}
Prove that there is a non-decreasing sequence of Riemannian metric tensors
$g_0\le g_1\le ...$ such that the induced metrics converge to the given sub-Riemannian metrics.
The metric $g_0$ can be assumed to be a metric on round sphere.

Applying the construction as in Nash--Kuiper theorem,
one can produce a sequence of smooth embeddings $h_n\:\mathbb{S}^m\to \RR^{m+1}$ with the induced metrics $g_n'$
such that $|g_n'-g_n|\to 0$.

Moreover, assume we assign a positive real number $\eps(h)$ for any smooth embedding $h\:\mathbb{S}^m\to\RR^{m+1}$.
Then we can assume that 
\[|h_{n+1}(x)-h_n(x)|<\eps(h_n)\] for any $x\in \mathbb{S}^m$ and $n$.

Show that for a right choice of function $\eps(h_n)$,
the sequence $h_n$ converges, say to $h_\infty$, 
and the metric induced by $h_\infty$ coincides with the given sub-Riemannian metric.

\parit{Comments.} 
The problem appeared 
on this list first rediscovered later by Enrico Le Donne in \cite{le-donne}.
Similar construction described in the the lecture notes by Allan Yashinski and me \cite[see][]{petrunin-yashinsky}

\textit{Length-preserving map.}
The solution uses Rademacher's theorem,
which states that any Lipschitz function $f\:\RR^n\to\RR$ 
is differentiable almost everywhere.
The Rademacher's theorem appears in \cite{rademacher}. 

\parit{Solution.}
Assume there is a length-preserving map $f\:\RR^2\to \RR$.

Note that $f$ is Lipschitz.
Therefore by Rademacher's theorem, $f$ is differentiable almost everywhere.

Fix a unit vector $u$.
Prove that, for almost all $x$, the length of curve 
$\alpha\:t\mapsto x+t\cdot u$, $t\in[0,1]$ can be expressed as the integral
\[\int\limits_0^1 (d_{\alpha(t)}f)(u) \cdot dt.\]

It follows that $|d_xf(v)|=|v|$ for almost all $x,v\in\RR^2$;
in particular $d_xf$ is defined and has rank 2 at some point $x$, a contradiction.  

\parit{Comments.} 
The idea above can be also used to solve the following problem.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Assume $\rho$ is a metric on $\RR^2$

$(\RR^2,\rho)$ is isometric to the Euclidean plane.}

Note that $2$-dimensional hyperbolic space 
can be viewed as $(\RR^2,g)$, where 
\[g(x,y)=\left(\begin{matrix}
     1&0
     \\
     0&e^{x}
    \end{matrix}\right).\]
The same way $3$-dimensional hyperbolic space 
can be viewed as $(\RR^3,h)$, where 
where 
\[h(x,y,z)=\left(\begin{matrix}

     \\
     0&e^{x}&0
     \\

Prove that the map $\RR^3\to \RR^4$ defined as
$$(x,y,z)\mapsto (x,y,x,z)$$
is a quasi-isometry from $(\RR^3,h)$ to its image in $(\RR^2,g)\times (\RR^2,g)$.

\parit{Comments.}
In the proof we used that horosphere in the hyperbolic space is isometric to the Euclidean plane.
This observation appears already in the book of Nikolai Lobachevsky \cite[see][34]{lobachevsky}.

\parbf{\ref{Fixed segment}.} 
\textit{Fixed segment.}
Note that it is sufficient to show that 
if 
\[f(a)=a\ \ \text{and}\ \ f(b)=b\]
for some $a,b\in\RR^m$,
then 
\[f(\tfrac{a+b}2)=\tfrac12\cdot(f(a)+f(b)).\]

(This statement is not trivial since in general
metric midpoint of $a$ and $b$ in $(\RR^m,d)$ 
are not defined uniquely.)

Without loss of generality, we can assume that $b+a=0$.

Set $f_0=f$.
Consider the recursively defined sequence of isometries $f_0$, $f_1,\dots$ defined recursively
\[f_{n+1}(x)= -f_n^{-1}(-f_n(x)).\]

Note that $f_n(a)=a$ and $f_n(b)=b$ for any $n$ and 
$$|f_{n+1}(0)|=2\cdot|f_n(0)|.$$
The latter condition implies that 
if $f(0)\ne 0$,
then $|f_n(0)|\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$.
On the other hand, since $f_n$ is isometry and $f(a)=a$,
we get $|f_n(0)|\le 2\cdot |a|$, a contradiction.

\parit{Comments.}
The problem is a stripped version of Mazur--Ulam theorem proved in  \cite{mazur-ulam};
it states that any isometry of $(\RR^m,d)$ to itself 
forms an affine map.

Positivity and symmetry of $\rho$ is evident.

The triangle inequality follows since
\[[B(x,\tfrac \pi2)\backslash B(y,\tfrac\pi2)]
\cup 
[B(y,\tfrac\pi2)\backslash B(z,\tfrac\pi2)]
\supset 
B(x,\tfrac \pi2) \backslash B(z,\tfrac\pi2).

Note that we get equality in $(*)$ if and only if $y$ lies on the great circle arc from $x$ to $z$.
Therefore the second statement follows.

This construction was given by 
Aleksei Pogorelov in \cite{pogorelov}.

\textit{Straight geodesics.}
From uniqueness of straight segment between given points in $\RR^m$,
it follows that any straight line in $\RR^m$ forms a geodesic in $(\RR^m,\rho)$.

Set 
\[\|\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}=\rho(\bm{x},(\bm{x}+\bm{v})).\]
Note that 
\[ \|\lambda\cdot\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}
=
|\lambda|\cdot\|\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}\]
for any $\bm{x},\bm{v}\in\RR^m$ and $\lambda\in\RR$.

Prove that 
\[
\|\lambda\cdot\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}
-
\|\lambda\cdot\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}'}
\le 
\Const\cdot |\bm{x}-\bm{x'}|\]
for any $\bm{x},\bm{x'},\bm{v}\in\RR^m$, 
$\lambda\in\RR$
and some fixed $\Const\in\RR$.

Passing to the limit as $\lambda\to\infty$, 
we get
$\|\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}$ does not depend on $\bm{x}$;
hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.} 
The idea in the proof is due to Thomas Foertsch
and Viktor Schroeder \cite[see][]{foertsch-schroeder}.
A more general statement was proved by Petra Hitzelberger and Alexander Lytchak in \cite{hitzelberger-lytchak}.
Namely they show that 
if any pair of points in a geodesic metric space $X$ can be separated by an affine,
then $X$ is isometric to a convex subset a normed vector space.

\parbf{\ref{hom-near-QI}.} 
\textit{A homeomorphism near quasi-isometry.}\\
\textit{Prerequisite.}
The solution requires a corollary of the theorem  proved by Laurence Siebenmann in \cite{siebenmann}.
It states that 
if $V_1, V_2\subset\RR^m$ are open
and the two embedding $f_1\:V_1\to\RR^m$ and $f_2\:V_2\to\RR^m$ 
are sufficiently close to each other 
on the overlap $U=V_1\cap V_2$, 
then
there is an embedding $f$ defined on an open set $W'$
which is slightly smaller than $W=V_1\cup V_2$
and such that $f$ is sufficiently close to each $f_1$ and $f_2$ at the points where they are defined.

The  bi-Lipschitz version requires 
an analogous statement in the category of bi-Lipschitz embeddings;
it was proved by
Dennis Sullivan in \cite{sullivan}.

\parit{Solution.}
Let $M\ge 1$ and $A\ge 0$.
Define $(M,A)$-quasi-isometry
as a map $f\:X\to Y$ between metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that for any $x,y\in X$,
 we have
\[\tfrac1M\cdot |x-y|-A\le |f(x)-f(y)|\le M\cdot |x-y|+A\]
and any point in $Y$ lies on the distance at most $A$ from a point in the image $f(X)$.

{\sloppy
Note that $(M,0)$-quasi-isometry is a $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map.
Moreover,
if $f_n\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ is a  $(M,\frac1n)$-quasi-isometry 
for each $n$, 
then any partial limit of $f_n$ as $n\to\infty$
is a $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map.

}

It follows that given $M\ge 1$ and $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that 
for any $(M,\delta)$-quasi-isometry $f\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ and any $p\in \RR^m$
there is an $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map $h\:B(p,1)\to \RR^m$
such that
\[|f(x)-h(x)|<\eps\]
for any $x\in B(p,1)$.

Applying rescaling, we can get the following equivalent formulation. 
Given $M\ge 1$, $A\ge 0$ and $\eps>0$
there is big enough $R>0$ such that for any $(M,A)$-quasi-isometry 
$f\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ and any $p\in\RR^m$ there is a $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map $h\:B(p,R)\to \RR^m$
such that 
\[|f(x)-h(x)|<\eps\cdot R\]
for any $x\in B(p,R)$.

Now cover $\RR^m$ by balls
$B(p_n,R)$, construct a $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map $h_n\:B(p_n,R)\to \RR^m$ for each $n$.

The maps $h_n$ are $2\cdot \eps\cdot R$ close to each other on the overlaps of their domains of definition.
This makes possible to deform slightly each $h_n$ so that they agree on the overlaps.
This can be done by Siebenmann's Theorem.
If instead you apply Sullivan's theorem, you get a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism $h\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$.

\textit{Bounded orbit.}
Note that we can assume that the orbit $x_n=\iota^n(x)$ is dense in $X$;
otherwise pass to the closure of this orbit.
In particular, we can choose a finite number of positive integers values $n_1$, $n_2,\dots,n_k$
such that the points $x_{n_1}$, $x_{n_2},\dots,x_{n_k}$ form a $\tfrac1{10}$-net in $B(x_0,10)$.

Prove that that 
if $x_m\in B(x_0,1)$, 
then $x_{m+n_i}\in B(x_0,1)$ for some $i\in\{1,\dots,k\}$.

Set $N=\max_i\{n_i\}$.
It follows 
that among any $N$ elements in a row $x_{i+1},\dots x_{i+N}$
there is at least one in $B(x_0,1)$.
In particular, $N$ isometric copies of $B(x_0,1)$ cover whole $X$.
Hence the result follows.

\parbf{\ref{Finite action}.}
\textit{Finite action.}
Without loss of generality, we may assume that the action is generated by a nontrivial homeomorphism 
\[a\:\mathbb{S}^m\to\mathbb{S}^m\] 
and $a^p=\id_{\mathbb{S}^m}$ for some prime $p$.

Assume that any $a$-orbit lies in an open hemisphere.
Then 
\[h(x)=\sum_{n=1}^p a^n\cdot x\ne0\]
for any $x\in\mathbb{S}^m$.

Consider the map $f\:\mathbb{S}^m\to\mathbb{S}^m$ 
defined as  $f(x)=\tfrac{h(x)}{|h(x)|}$.
Note that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item if $a(x)=x$, then $f(x)=x$;
\item\label{f(x)=f(a(x))} $f(x)=f\circ a(x)$ for any $x\in\mathbb{S}^m$.
\end{enumerate}

Prove that $f$ is homotopic to the identity; 
in particular 
\[\deg f=1.\leqno({*})\]

Fix $x\in \mathbb{S}^m$ such that $a(x)\ne x$.
Note that $a$ acts without fixed points 
on the inverse image $W=f^{-1}(V)$ 
of a small open neighborhood $V\ni x$.
Therefore the quotient map $\theta\:W\to W'=W/\ZZ_p$ is a $p$-fold covering.
From  (\ref{f(x)=f(a(x))}),
the restriction $f|_W$ factors through $\theta$;
that is
there is $f'\:W'\to V$ such that
$f|_W=f'\circ\theta$.

Assume $p\ne 2$.
Show that $f'$ and $\theta$ have well defined degrees and 
\[\deg f\equiv\deg \theta\cdot\deg f'\pmod p\]
Since $\theta$ is a $p$-fold covering, we have $\deg \theta\equiv0\pmod p$.
Therefore
\[\deg f\equiv 0\pmod p.\leqno({*}{*})\]

Finally observe that $({*})$ contradicts $({*}{*})$.

In the case $p=2$ the same proof works, 
but the degrees have to be defined only modulo $2$.

\parit{Comments.}
Along the same lines one can get a lower bound for the maximal diameter of orbit for any nontrivial actions of finite groups on a Riemannian manifold.

Applying the problem to a conjugate action, one gets that 
if a fixed point set of a finite group action $F\acts \mathbb{S}^m$
has nonempty interior, 
then the action is trivial.
The same holds for any connected manifold;
it was proved by Max Newman in \cite{newman}.

The Newman's theorem was used by Deane Montgomery in \cite{montgomery} 
to show that 
\emph{if $h$ is a homeomorphism of a connected manifold $M$ 
such that each $h$-orbit is finite,
then $h^n=\id_M$ for some positive integer $n$}.

Consider the bipartite graph $\Gamma$ with vertices formed by the elements of $L$ and $M$
such that $\ell\in L$ is adjacent  to $m \in M$ if and only if $V_\ell\cap W_m\ne\emptyset$.

By $({*})$ the graph $\Gamma$ satisfies the condition in the Hall's marriage theorem.
Therefore there is a bijection $f\: L\to M$ such that 
\[V_\ell\cap W_{f(\ell)}\ne\emptyset\] for any $\ell\in L$. 

It remains to notice that $f$ is bi-Lipschitz.

\parit{Comments.} The problem is due to 
Dmitri Burago

For a finitely generated group $G$  
it is not known if $G$ and $G\times \ZZ_2$ can fail to be bi-Lipschitz.

\parbf{\ref{Piecewise Euclidean quotient}.} 
\textit{Piecewise Euclidean quotient.}
Note that the group $\Gamma$ serves as holonomy group of the quotient space $P=\RR^m/\Gamma$ with the induced polyhedral metric.
More precisely, one can identify $\RR^m$ with the tangent space of a regular point $x_0$ of $P$ in such a way that
for any $\gamma\in\Gamma$ there is a loop $\ell$ in $P$ which pass only through regular points and has the holonomy $\gamma$.

Fix $\gamma\in\Gamma$. 
Let $\ell$ be the corresponding loop.
Since $P$ is simply connected, we can shrink $\ell$ by a disc.
By general position argument we can assume that the disc 
only pass through simplices of codimension $0$, $1$ and $2$
and intersect the simplices of codimension $2$ transversely.

In other words, $\ell$ can be presented as a product of 
loops such that each loop goes around a single simplex of codimension $2$ and comes back.
The holonomy for each of these loops is a rotation around a hyperplane.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
The converse to the problem also holds;
it was proved by Christian Lange in \cite{lange},
his proof based earlier results of 
Marina Mikhailova \cite[see][]{mikhailova}.

Note that the cone over spherical suspension over Poincar\'e sphere is homeomorphic to $\RR^5$ and it is quotient of $\RR^5$ by a finite subgroup of $\SO(5)$. 
Therefore, 
if one exchanges ``PL-homeomorphism'' to ``homeomorphism'' in the formulation, 
then the answer is different; 
a complete classification of such actions was also obtained in \cite{lange}.

Let $W$ be the wedge sum of $m$ circles, 
so  $\pi_1(W,p)=F$.
Equip $W$ with the length-metric 
such that each circle has unit length.

Pass to the metric cover $\tilde W$ of $W$

Fix sufficiently large integer $n$ and consider doubling of the closed ball $\bar B(\tilde p,n+\frac12)$ in its boundary.
Let us denote the obtained doubling by $Z_n$ and set $G_n=\pi(Z_n,\tilde p)$.

Prove that $Z_n$ is a metric covering of $W$;
it makes possible to consider $G_n$ as a subgroup of $F$.
By construction, $Z_n$ is compact;
therefore $G_n$ has finite order in $F$.


It remains to show that that 
\[G=\bigcap_{n>k} G_n,\]
where $k$ is the maximal length of word in the generating set of $G$.

Consider universal Riemannian cover $\tilde M$ of $M$.
Note that $\tilde M$ is non-negatively curved and

Fix $p\in \tilde M$.
Given  $a\in \pi_1M$,
set 
\[|a|=|p- a\cdot p|_{\tilde M}.\]
Construct a sequence of elements $a_1,a_2,\dots\in \pi_1M$ the following way:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Choose $a_1\in\pi_1M$ so that $|a_1|$ takes the minimal value.
\item Choose $a_2\in\pi_1M\backslash\langle a_1 \rangle$ so that $|a_2|$ takes the minimal value.
\item Choose $a_3\in\pi_1M\backslash\langle a_1,a_2 \rangle$ so that $|a_2|$ takes the minimal value.
\item and so on.
\end{enumerate}

Note that the sequence terminates at $n$-th step 
if 
$(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ forms a generating system.
By construction, we have
\begin{align*}
|a_j\cdot a_i^{-1}|&\ge |a_j|\ge |a_i|

\textit{Positive Dehn twist.}
Consider the universal covering 
$\tilde\Sigma\to\Sigma$.
The surface $\tilde \Sigma$ comes with the orientation induced from $\Sigma$.

Note that we may assume that $\tilde\Sigma$ has infinite number of boundary components.

Fix a point $x_0$ on the boundary of $\tilde \Sigma$.
Given other points $y$ and $z$ we will write
$y\prec z$ if $z$ lies on the left side from one (and therefore any) simple curve from $x_0$ to $y$ in $\tilde\Sigma$.
Note that  $\prec$ defines a linear order on $\partial\tilde\Sigma\backslash\{x_0\}$.
We will write $y\preceq z$ 
if $y\prec z$ or $y=z$.

Note that any homeomorphism $h\:\Sigma\to\Sigma$ which is identity on the boundary
lifts to unique homeomorphism $\tilde h\:\tilde \Sigma\to\tilde\Sigma$ 
is such a way that $\tilde h(x_0)=x_0$.

Assume $h$ is positive Dehn twist.
Show that 
$y\preceq \tilde h(y)$ for any  $y\in\partial\tilde\Sigma\backslash\{x_0\}$
and there is a point $y_0\in\partial\tilde\Sigma\backslash\{x_0\}$
such that $y_0\prec \tilde h(y_0)$.

Finally note that the latter property is a homotopy invariant 
and it survives under compositions of maps.
Hence the statement follows.

\textit{Conic neighborhood.}
Let $V$ and $W$ be two conic neighborhoods of $p$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $V\subset W$.

We will need to construct a sequence of embeddings $f_n\:V\to W$
such that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item 
For any compact set $K\subset V$ 
there is a positive integer $n=n_K$ such that 
$f_n(k)=f_m(k)$ for any $k\in K$ and $m\ge n$.
\item For any point $w\in W$ there is a point $v\in V$ such that $f_n(v)=w$ for all large $n$.
\end{enumerate}

Note that once such sequence is constructed, $f\:V\to W$ defined as $f(v)=f_n(v)$ for all large values of $n$ gives the needed homeomorphism.

The sequence $f_n$ can be constructed recursively, setting
\[f_{n+1}=\Psi_n\circ f_n\circ \Phi_n,\]
where $\Phi_n\:V\to V$ 
and $\Psi_n\:W\to W$ 
are homeomorphisms
of the form 
\[\Phi_n(x)=\phi_n(x)\cdot x\quad \Phi_n(x)=\psi_n(x)\cdot x,\]
where $\phi_n\:V\to \RR_+$, $\psi_n\:W\to \RR_+$ are suitable continuous functions 
and 
``$\cdot$'' denotes the ``multiplication'' in the cone structures of $V$ and $W$ correspondingly.

By Tietze extension theorem,
the homeomorphisms $\phi\:K_1\to K_2$ and $\phi^{-1}\:K_2\to K_1$ can be extended to a continuous maps,
say $f\:\RR^m\to \RR^m$ and $g\:\RR^m\to \RR^m$ correspondingly.

We get a homeomorphism say $\tilde h\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ such that $\tilde h(x)=h(x)$ for any $x\in\square^m$ and 
\[\tilde h\circ\gamma=\gamma\circ \tilde h\]

\parit{Comments.} 
The problem is a stripped from the proof of Robion Kirby in \cite{kirby}.
The condition that face is mapped to face can be removed and 
instead of homeomorphism one can take an embedding which is close enough to the identity.

An interesting twist to this idea was given by Dennis Sullivan in \cite{sullivan}.
Instead of the discrete group of motions of Euclidean space,
he use a discrete group of motions of hyperbolic space in the Poincare model.
Say, assume we repeat the same argument if instead of cube we have a Coxeter polytope in the hyperbolic space.
Then the constructed map 
coincides with the identity on the absolute and therefore the last ``shrinking'' step in the proof above is not needed.
Moreover, 
if the original homeomorphism is bi-Lipschitz,
then the construction also produce a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism;
this is the main advantage of Sullivan's construction.

that is $O_p=O_q$ if and only if $p=q$.

Let us write $p\preccurlyeq q$ 
if $O_p\subset O_q$.
The relation $\preccurlyeq$ is a partial order on $F$.

Let us construct a simplicial complex $K$ 
by taking $F$ as the set of its vertices
and saying that a collection of vertices form a simplex 
if they can form a an increasing sequence with respect to $\preccurlyeq$.

Given $k\in K$,
consider the minimal simplex $(f_0,\dots,f_m)\ni k$;
we can assume that $f_0\preccurlyeq \dots\preccurlyeq f_m$.
Set $h\:k\mapsto f_0$;
it defines a map $K\to F$.

It remains to check that $h$ is continues 
and induces an isomorphism of all the homotopy groups.

In a similar fashion, one can construct a finite topological space $F$ for given simplicial complex $K$

\textit{Spherical arm lemma.}
Let us cut the polygon $A$ from the sphere and glue instead the polygon $B$.
Denote by $\Sigma$ the obtained spherical polyhedral space.
Note that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Sigma$ is homeomorphic $\mathbb S^2$.
\item $\Sigma$ has curvature $\ge 1$ in the sense of Alexandrov; that is, the total angle around each singular point is less than $2\cdot \pi$.
\item All the singular points of $\Sigma$ 
lie outside of an isometric copy of a hemisphere $\mathbb{S}^2_+\subset \Sigma$
\end{itemize}

It is sufficient to show that $\Sigma$ is isometric to the standard sphere.
Assume the contrary.
If $n$ denotes be the number of singular points in $\Sigma$, 
it means that $n>0$.

We will arrive to a contradiction applying induction on $n$.
The base case $n=1$ is trivial; 
that is, $\Sigma$ cannot have single singular point.

Now assume $\Sigma$ has $n>1$ singular points.
Choose two singular points $p, q$,
cut $\Sigma$ along a geodesic $[pq]$
and patch the hole so that the obtained new polyhedron $\Sigma'$ has curvature $\ge 1$.
The patch is obtained by doubling a
spherical triangle in two sides.
For the right choice of the triangle,
the points $p$ and $q$ become regular in $\Sigma'$
and exactly one new singular point appears in the patch.

This way, constructed a  spherical polyhedral space $\Sigma'$
with $n-1$ singular points which satisfy the same conditions as $\Sigma$ 

By induction hypothesis $\Sigma'$ does not exist. Hence the result follow.

\parit{Alternative end of proof.} 
By Alexandrov embedding theorem, $\Sigma$ is isometric to the surface of convex polyhedron $P$ in the unit 3-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^3$. 
The center of hemisphere has to lie in a facet, say $F$ of $P$.
It remains to note that $F$ contains the equator and therefore $P$ has to be hemisphere in $\mathbb S^3$ or intersection of two hemispheres.
In both cases its surface is isometric to $\mathbb S^2$.

Prove that the triangulation can be subdivided if necessary
so that Voronoi domain of each vertex is isometric to a convex subset in the cone with vertex corresponding to the tip.

Note that the boundaries of all the Voronoi domains form a graph with straight edges.
One can triangulate $P$ so that each triangle has such edge as the base 
and the opposite vertex is the center of an adjusted Voronoi domain; such a vertex will be called \emph{main} vertex of the triangle.

Fix a triangle $\triangle vab$ in the constructed triangulation; 
let $v$ be its main vertex.
Given a point 
$x\in  \triangle$, set 
\[\rho(x)=|x-v|\ \ \text{and}\ \  \theta(x)=\min \{\measuredangle \hinge vax,\measuredangle\hinge vbx\}.\]
Map $x$ to the plane the point with polar coordinates $(\rho(x),\theta(x))$.

Prove that $\Omega$ is the interior of a polygon

Redefine the map $f$ inside $\Omega$ so that it remains piecewise liner length-preserving and $f(a_1)=b_1$.

Finally show that in this case exchanging triangles $\triangle pxy$ and $\triangle qxy$

That is, $T$ is not area minimizing, a contradiction.

For general polyhedral surface, the deformation which decrease the lengths of all edges may not decrease the area.
Moreover, the surface which minimize the area among all surfaces with fixed  triangulation might be not saddle;

Arguing by contradiction, let us assume that $P\subset \RR^m$
is a counterexample and $m$ takes minimal possible value.

Choose a finite cover $B_1,B_2,\dots B_n$ of $K$,
where $B_i=B(z_i,\eps_i)$ 
and $B_i\cap P=B_i\cap K_i$, 
where $K_i$ is a cone with the tip at $z_i$.

For each $i$, consider function $f_i(x)=|z_i-x|^2-\eps_i^2$.
Note that
\[W_{i,j}=\set{x\in\RR^m}{f_i(x)=f_j(x)}\]
is a hyperplane for any pair $i\ne j$.

The subset $P_{i,j}=P\cap W_{i,j}$ satisfies the same assumptions as $P$, but lies in a hyperplane.
Since $m$ is minimal, we get that $P_{i,j}$ is a polytope for any pair $i,j$.

Consider Voronoi domains 
\[V_{i}=\set{x\in\RR^m}{f_i(x)\ge f_j(x) \ \text{for any}\ j}.\]
Note that $P\cap V_i$ is formed by the points which lie on the segments from $z_i$ to a point in  $P\cap \partial V_i$.

The statement follows since $\partial V_i$ is covered by the hyperplanes $W_{i,j}$.

\parbf{\ref{panov-S^3}.} 
\textit{A sphere with one edge.}
An example, say $P$, can be found among the spherical polyhedral spaces which admit
an isometric $\mathbb{S}^1$-action with geodesic orbits.

Fix large relatively prime integers $p>q$. 
Consider the triangle $\Delta$ with angles $\tfrac\pi p$, $\tfrac\pi q$ and say $\pi\cdot(1-\tfrac1 p)$ in the sphere of radius $\tfrac12$.
Denote by $\hat \Delta$ the  doubling of $\Delta$ in its boundary.
Note that $\hat \Delta$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb S^2$,
it has 3 singular points with total angles $2\cdot\tfrac\pi p$,
$2\cdot\tfrac\pi q$ and $2\cdot\pi\cdot(1-\tfrac1 p)$.

Consider $\mathbb S^1$-action on $\mathbb S^3\subset\CC^2$ by the diagonal matrices $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}z^p&0\\0&z^q\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, $z\in\mathbb S^1\subset\CC$.
Construct a spherical polyhedral metric $\rho$ on  $\mathbb S^3$
such that the $\mathbb S^1$-orbits become geodesics 
and the quotient $(\mathbb S^3,\rho)/\mathbb S^1$
is isometric to $\hat \Delta$.

In the constructed example 
the singular points with total angles $2\cdot\tfrac\pi p$ and
$2\cdot\tfrac\pi q$
should correspond to the points with isotropy groups $\ZZ/p$ and $\ZZ/q$ of the action.
The points in $P=(\mathbb{S}^3,d)$ on the orbits over these points will be regular points of $P$.
The singular locus $P^\star$
of $P$ will be formed by the orbit corresponding to the remaining singular point of  $\hat \Delta$.
By construction,
\begin{itemize}
\item $P^\star$ is a closed geodesic with angle $2\cdot\pi\cdot(1-\tfrac1p)$ around it.
\item $P^\star$ forms a $(p,q)$-torus knot in the ambient $\mathbb{S}^3$.
\end{itemize}


\parit{Comments.}
It is expected that only the torus knots can appear this way.

The construction given by Dmitri Panov in \cite{panov-Kaeler}.
The cone $K$ over $P$ is a polyhedral space with natural complex structure;
that is, one can cut simplices from $\CC^2$ and the glue the cone from them in such a way that complex structures will agree along the gluings.
Moreover the cone $K$ can be holomorphically parametrized by $\CC^2$ in such a way that its singular set becomes an algebraic curve $z^p=w^q$ in some $(z,w)$-coordinates of $\CC^2$.

\parbf{\ref{Triangulation of a torus}.} 
\textit{Triangulation of a torus.}
Let us equip the torus with the flat metric such that each triangle is equilateral.
The metric will have two singular cone points,
the first corresponds to the vertex $v_5$ with 5 triangles,
the total angle around this point is $\tfrac53\cdot\pi$
and the second corresponds to the vertex $v_7$ with 7 triangles,
the total angle around this point is $\tfrac73\cdot\pi$.

Prove the following.

\parbf{Observation} \textit{The holonomy group of this metric is generated by rotation by $\tfrac\pi3$.}

\medskip

Consider a closed geodesic $\gamma_1$ which minimize the length of all circles which are not null-homotopic.
Let $\gamma_2$ be an other closed geodesic which minimize the length and is not homotopic to any power of $\gamma_1$.

Show that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ intersect at a single point.

Show that $\gamma_i$ cannot pass $v_5$.

Apply the observation above 
to show that 
if $\gamma_i$ pass through $v_7$,
then the measure  
of one of two angles which $\gamma_i$ cuts at $v_7$ equals to $\pi$.
Use the latter statement to show that  
one can push $\gamma_i$ aside so it does not longer pass through $v_7$, but remains a closed geodesic.

Cut $\TT^2$ along $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.
In the obtained quadrilateral, connect $v_5$ to $v_7$ by a minimizing geodesic and cut along it.
This way we obtain an annulus with flat metric.
Look at the neighborhood of the boundary components and show that the annulus can and cannot be isometrically immersed into the plane;
this is a contradiction.

\parit{Comments.}
There are flat metrics on the torus with 
only two singular points 
which have the total angles $\tfrac53\cdot\pi$ and $\tfrac73\cdot\pi$.
Such example can be obtained by identifying the the hexagon on the picture  according to the arrows.
But the holonomy group of the obtained torus is generated by the rotation by angle $\tfrac\pi6$. 
In particular, the observation is necessary in the proof.

The same argument shows that 
holonomy group of flat torus with exactly two singular points with total angle $2\cdot(1\pm \tfrac1n)\cdot\pi$ has more than $n$ elements.
In the solution we did the case $n=6$.

The problem was originally discovered and solved by Stanislav Jendrol' %???\soft{l}
and Ernest Jucovi\v{c}, in \cite{jendrol-jucovich},
their proof is combinatorial.
The solution described above was given by Rostislav Matveyev
in his lectures \cite[see][]{matveyev}.

\parbf{\ref{Unique geodesics imply CAT}.} 
\textit{Unique geodesics imply $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$.}
Uniqueness of geodesics implies that $P$ is contractible.
In particular, $P$ is simply connected.

It remains to prove that $P$ is locally $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$;
equivalently, the space of directions $\Sigma_p$
at any point $p\in P$ is  a $\mathrm{CAT}(1)$ space.

We can assume that the statement holds in all dimensions less than $\dim P$. 
In particular, $\Sigma_p$ is locally $\mathrm{CAT}(1)$.
If $\Sigma_p$ is not $\mathrm{CAT}(1)$,
then it contains a periodic geodesic $\gamma$ of length $\ell<2\cdot\pi$,
such that any arc of $\gamma$ of length $\tfrac\ell2$ is length minimizing.

Consider two points $x$ and $y$
in the tangent cone of $p$
in directions $\gamma(0)$ and $\gamma(\tfrac\ell2)$.
Show that there are two distinct minimizing geodesics between $x$ and $y$.
The latter leads to a contradiction.

\parit{Comments.}
The existence of geodesic $\gamma$ was proved by Brian Bowditch in \cite{bowditch};
a simpler proof can be found in the book 
by Stephanie Alexander, Vitali Kapovitch and me \cite[see][]{akp}.

\parbf{\ref{No simple geodesics}.} 
\textit{No simple geodesics.}
The curvature of a vertex on the surface of a convex polyhedron
is defined as the $2\cdot\pi-\theta$, where $\theta$ is the total angle around the vertex.

Notice that a simple closed geodesic cuts the surface into two discs with total curvature $2\cdot\pi$ each.
Therefore it is sufficient to construct a convex polyhedron with curvatures of the vertices $\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots,\omega_n$ such that
$2\cdot\pi$ cannot be obtained as sum of some of $\omega_i$.
An example of that type can be found among 3-simplexes.

\textit{Box in a box.}
Let $\Pi$ be a parallelepiped
with dimensions $a$, $b$ and $c$.
Denote by $v(r)$ the volume of  $r$-neighborhoods of $\Pi$,
 
Note that for all positive $r$ we have
\[v(r)=w_3+w_2\cdot r+w_1\cdot r^2+w_0\cdot r^3,\leqno({*})\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $w_0=\tfrac43\cdot \pi$ is the volume of unit ball,
\item $w_1=\pi\cdot (a+b+c)$,
\item $w_2=2\cdot(a\cdot b+b\cdot c+c\cdot a)$ is the surface area of $\Pi$,
\item $w_3=a\cdot b\cdot c$ is the volume of $\Pi$,
\end{itemize}

Assume $\Pi'$ be an other parallelepiped
with dimensions $a'$, $b'$ and $c'$.
For the volume $v'(r)$ the volume of  $r$-neighborhoods of $\Pi'$ we have a formula similar $({*})$.

Note that 
if $\Pi\subset \Pi'$,
then $v(r)\le v'(r)$ for any $r$.
Checking this inequality for $r\to\infty$,
we get 
\[a+b+c\le a'+b'+c'.\]

\parit{Comments.}
The problem was discussed 
by Alexander Shen in \cite{shen}.

A formula analogous to $({*})$
holds for arbitrary convex body $B$ in arbitrary dimension $m$.
The coefficient $w_i(B)$ in the polynomial with different normalization constants 
appear under different names most commonly
\emph{intrinsic volume} and
\emph{quermassintegral}.
They also can be defined as the average 
of area of projections of $B$ to the $i$-dimensional planes.
In particular 
if $B'$ and $B$ are convex bodies such that $B'\subset B$,
then $w_i(B')\le w_i(B)$ for any $i$.
This generalize our problem quite a bit.
Further generalizations lead to so called \emph{mixed volumes} \cite[see][]{burago-zalgaller}.

\textit{Harnack's circles.}
Let $\sigma\subset \RP^2$ be a smooth algebraic curve of degree $d$.
Consider the complexification $\Sigma\subset \CP^2$ of $\sigma$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\Sigma$ is regular.

Prove that all regular complex algebraic curves of degree $d$ in $\RP^2$
are homeomorphic to each other; 
denote by $g$ their genus.
Perturbing a singular curve formed by  $d$ lines in $\CP^2$,
we get that 
\[g=\tfrac12\cdot(d-1)\cdot(d-2).\]

The real curve $\sigma$ forms the fixed point set in $\Sigma$ 
by the complex conjugation. 
Use it to show that $\Sigma\backslash\sigma$ has at most 2 connected components.
Hence the result follows.

The inequality was originally proved 
by Axel Harnack with a different method \cite[see][]{harnack}.

Take any complete ordering of the set of all lines

Assume we have a set of points $X$ such that each line intersects $X$ at at most $2$ points and cardinality of $X$ is less than continuum.

Choose the least line $\ell$ in the ordering which intersect $X$ 
by $0$ or $1$ point.
Note that the set of all lines intersecting $X$ at two points has cardinality less than continuum.
Therefore we can choose a point on $\ell$ and add it to $X$ so that the remaining lines are not overloaded.

It remains to apply well ordering principle.

Denote by $W_i$ the reflection of $W$ in $\Pi_i$.

Prove that $W_i$ and $W_j$ have no common interior points if $i\ne j$;

and $h_1(F)\subset  \{0\}\times\RR^m$.

Show that the following homotopy is monotonic
\[h_t(x)=\bigl(h_0(x)\cdot \cos\tfrac{\pi\cdot t}2

The dimension $2\cdot m$ is optimal;

Any vertex this cube has the form $\bm{q}=(q_1,q_2,\dots,q_m)$,

For each vertex $\bm{q}$,
consider the intersection of the corresponding octant with the unit sphere;
that is, the set
\[V_{\bm{q}}=\set{(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_m)\in\mathbb{S}^{m-1}}{q_i\cdot x_i\ge 0\ \text{for each}\ i}.\]

Consider the set $\mathcal{A}\subset\mathbb{S}^{m-1}$
formed by the union of all the sets $V_{\bm{q}}$ for $\bm{q}\in A$.
Note that 
\[\vol_{m-1}\mathcal{A}=\tfrac12\cdot\vol_{m-1}\mathbb{S}^{m-1}\]
and 
\[\vol_{m-2}\partial\mathcal{A}

\tfrac k{2^{m-1}}\cdot\vol_{m-2}\mathbb{S}^{m-2},\]
where $k$ is the number of edges of the cube with one end in $A$ and the other in $B$.

It remains to  show that 
\[\vol_{m-2}\partial\mathcal{A}

{\it For any distinct $x_i$ and $x_j$
and any interior point $z$ in $K$
we have 
\[\measuredangle \hinge{x_i}{x_j}z<\tfrac\pi2.\]}

Denote by $h_i$ the homothety with center at $x_i$ and coefficient $\tfrac12$.
Set $K_i=h_i(K)$.

Let us show that $K_i$ and $K_j$ have no comon interior point.
Assume contry; that is $z=h_i(z_i)=h_j(z_j)$;
for some interior points $z_i$ and $z_j$ in $K$.
Note that 
\[
\measuredangle\hinge{x_i}{x_j}{z_i}
+
\measuredangle\hinge{x_j}{x_i}{z_j}
=

which contradicts the claim.

Note that $K_i\subset K$ for any $i$;
it follows that 
\begin{align*}
\tfrac m{2^n}\cdot \vol K

\textit{Prerequisite.}
Before coming into proof read 
about \hyperref[Dehn--Sommerville equations]{\emph{Dehn--Sommerville equations}}
on page \pageref{Dehn--Sommerville equations}.

\parit{Solution.}
Let $P$ be a right-angled hyperbolic polyhedron of dimension $m$.
Note that $P$ is simple; that is, exactly $m$ facets meet at each vertex of $P$.

From the projective model of hyperbolic plane, 
one can see that for any simple compact hyperbolic polyhedron there is a simple Euclidean polyhedron with the same combinatorics. 
In particular Dehn--Sommerville equations hold for $P$.

Denote by $(f_0,f_1,\dots f_m)$ and $(h_0,h_1,\dots h_m)$ the $f$- and $h$-vectors of $P$.
Recall that $h_i\ge 0$ for any $i$ and $h_0=h_m=1$.
By Dehn--Sommerville equations, we get
\[f_2> \tfrac{m-2}4\cdot f_1.
\leqno({*})\]

Since $P$ is hyperbolic, each 2-dimensional face of $P$ has at least 5 sides.
It follows that
\[f_2\le \tfrac{m-1}5\cdot f_1.\]
The latter contradicts $({*})$ for $m\ge 6$.

\parit{Comments.} 
The proof above 
is the core of proof of nonexistence of compact hyperbolic Coxeter's polyhedra of large dimensions 
given by Ernest Vinberg in \cite{vinberg},

Playing a bit more with the same inequalities, 
one gets nonexistence of  right-angled hyperbolic polyhedra,
in all dimensions starting from $5$.
In 4-dimensional case, an example of a bonded right-angled hyperbolic polyhedron
can be found among regular \emph{120-cells}.
