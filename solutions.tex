\textit{Geodesic for birds.}
Consider a geodesic 
\[t\mapsto(x(t),y(t),z(t))\] 
in $W$;
assume it is defined in the interval $\II\subset \RR$.
Let us denote by $\phi$ the variation of turn;
it is a measure on $\II$.
We need to estimate $\phi(\II)$.

Denote by $s=s(t)$ the natural parameter of the plane curve \[t\mapsto (x(t),y(t)).\]

Prove that the function $f\:s\mapsto z$ is concave.

Given a semiopen interval $\mathbb J=(a,b]\subset \II$,
set
$\mu(\mathbb J)=f^+(a)-f^+(b)$,
where $f^+$ denotes right derivatives.
The function $\mu$ extends to a measure which could be also written as
\[\mu=\tfrac{dz^2}{d^2s}\cdot ds.\]
if $\tfrac{dz^2}{d^2s}$ understood in the sense of distribution.
 
Note that $|\tfrac{dz}{ds}|\le \ell$.
In particular $\mu(\II)\le 2\cdot\ell$.

Further note that $\phi\le \sqrt{1+\ell^2}\cdot\mu$.
In particular, 
$$\phi(\II)\le 2\cdot\ell\cdot\sqrt{1+\ell^2}.$$

A straightforward improvement of these estimates gives the optimal bound
$$\phi(\II)\le 2\cdot\ell.$$

\parit{Comments.}
The problem appears in the paper of Berg, \cite{berg}.
The main observation 
in this proof (concavity of $s\mapsto z$) 
was used earlier by Liberman in \cite{liberman}
in order to bound on the variation of turn of a geodesic on a convex surface.

Without loss of generality we may assume that the curvature of $\gamma$ decreases in $t$.

Let $z(t)$ be the center of osculating circle at $\gamma(t)$
and $r(t)$ is its radius.
Prove that 
$$|z'(t)|\le r'(t).$$

Conclude that the osculating discs are nested;
i.e., $D_{t_1}\supset D_{t_0}$ for $t_1>t_0$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
The problem can be considered as a continuous analog of the Leibniz's test for alternating series.

It seems that the problem first discovered by Tait in \cite{tait}
and later reproved by Knesser in \cite{kneser};
see also \cite{ovsienko-tabachnikov}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Divergence}.}
\textit{Divergence.}
Fix a Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$ on the plane.
Denote by $D$ the unit disc centered at the origin;
so $\area F=\area D$.
 
Prove that there is a smooth area preserving map $F\to D$, 
of the form
$(x,y)\mapsto (v(x),w(x,y))$.

Show that the vector field $\bm{v}(x,y)=(v(x),w(x,y))$
is a solution for the problem.

\parit{Comments.}
This is the key ingredient in the famous proof of isoperimetric inequality --- to finish the proof apply the divergence formula for $\bm{v}$.

The same argument works in all dimensions.
See the Gromov's appendix in \cite{gromov-apendix} for more details.

\parbf{\ref{moon-in-puddle}.}
\textit{The moon in the puddle.}
Consider the {\it cut locus}
of $F$ with respect to $\partial F$;
it is defined as the closure
of the set of points $x\in F$ 
such that there are two or more points in $\partial F$ which minimize distance to $x$.
We will denote this cut locus by $W$.

Note that after a small perturbation
of $\partial F$ we may assume that
$W$ is a graph embedded in
$F$ with finite number of edges.

Note that $W$ is a
deformation retract of $F$.
The retraction can be obtained by moving each point $y\in F\setminus W$ to $W$
along the geodesic from the closest point to $y$ on $\partial F$ which pass through $y$.

In particular, $W$ is a tree.
Therefore $W$  has
at least two end vertices;
Denote one of them by $z$.

Prove that the disc of radius $1$ centered at $z$ lies completely in $F$.

\parit{Comments.} A spherical version of this problem was used by Panov and me in \cite{panov-petrunin-ramification}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{curve-in-S^2}.}
\textit{A curve in a sphere.}
Let $\alpha$ be a closed curve in $\mathbb{S}^2$ of length $2\cdot\ell$ which intesects each equator.

\parit{A solution with Crofton formula.}
Note that we can assume that $\alpha$ is a broken line.

Given a unit vector $u$ denote by $e_u$ the equator with pole at $u$.
Let $k(u)$ the number of intersections
of the $\alpha$ and $e_u$.

Note that for almost all $u\in \mathbb{S}^2$, the value $k(u)$ is even.
Since each equator intersects $\alpha$, we get $k(u)\ge 2$ for almost all $u$.

Applying Crofton formula, we get
\begin{align*}
2\cdot\ell&=\tfrac14\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2}k(u)\cdot\, d_u\area\ge 
\\
&\ge\tfrac12\cdot\area\mathbb{S}^2=
\\
&=2\cdot\pi.
\end{align*}
The \emph{Crofton formula} (i.e., the first identity above)
it is easy to obtain it for each geodesic segment of $\alpha$
and then sum it up.

\parit{Solution with symmetry.}
Let $\check\alpha$ be a subarc of $\alpha$ of length $\ell$, with endpoints $p$ and $q$.  
Let $z$ be the midpoint of a minimizing geodesic $[pq]$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$.  

Let $r$ be a point of intersection of $\alpha$ with the equator with pole at $z$.  
Without loss of generality we may assume that $r\in\check\alpha$. 

The arc $\check\alpha$ together with its reflection in $z$ form a closed curve of length $2\cdot \ell$ that passes through $r$ and its antipodal point $r'$.
Therefore 
\[\ell=\length \check\alpha\ge |r-r'|_{\mathbb S^2}=\pi.\]

\parit{Comments.} 
This problem is a the first step in the proof of Reshetnyak's motorization theorem for $\CAT[1]$ spaces, see \cite{akp}.
 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{A spring in a tin}.} \textit{A spring in a tin.}
Let $\alpha$ be a closed curve in the unit disc;
denote by $\ell$ its length.

Let us equip the plane with complex coordinates so that $0$ is the center of the unit disc.
We can assume that $\alpha$ equipped with $\ell$-periodic parametrization by length.

Consider the curve $\beta(t)=t-\tfrac{\alpha(t)}{\alpha'(t)}$.
Note that 
\[\beta(t+\ell)=\beta(t)+\ell\] 
for any $t$.
In particular 
\[\length (\beta|_{[0,\ell]}) 
\ge 
|\beta(\ell)-\beta(0)|
=
\ell.\]

Note that 
\begin{align*}
|\beta'(t)|&=|\tfrac{\alpha(t)\cdot\alpha''(t)}{\alpha'(t)^2}|\le
\\
&\le|\alpha''(t)|.
\end{align*}
Since $|\alpha''(t)|$ is the curvature of $\alpha$ at $t$,
we get the result.

\parit{Comment.}
This proof admits straightforward generalization to the higher dimensions.

If instead of a disc we have a region bounded by closed convex curve $\gamma$ then it is still true that the average absolute curvature of $\alpha$ is at least as big as average absolute curvature of $\gamma$. 
The proof is not that simple, see \cite{tabachnikov} and the reference there in.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Convex hat}.}
\textit{Convex hat.}
Let $\gamma$ be a minimizing geodesic with the ends in $\Delta$.

Assume $\gamma\backslash\Delta\ne\emptyset$.
Denote by $\gamma'$ the curve formed by $\gamma\cap \Delta$ 
and the reflection on $\gamma\backslash\Delta$ in $\Pi$.
Note 
\[\length\gamma'=\length\gamma\]
and $\gamma'$ runs partly in and partly outside of the surface, but does not get inside of $\Sigma$.

Denote by $\gamma''$ the closest point projection of $\gamma'$ on $\Sigma$.
The curve $\gamma''$ lies in $\Sigma$ has the same ends as $\gamma$.
It remains to note that 
\[\length\gamma''<\length\gamma;\]
the later leads to a contradiction.

 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Unbended geodesic}.} 
\textit{Unbended geodesic.}
Let $W$ be the closed unbounded set formed by $\Sigma$ and its exterior points.

Prove that for any $x\in\Sigma$ the distance $|x - p_t|$ is nondecreasing in $t$.

Use the later statement, to prove the same for $|x - p_t|_W$,
where $|x - p_t|_W$ stays for the intrinsic distance from $x$ to $p_t$ in $W$.

Prove that $|q - p|_W=|q - p|_\Sigma$, 
where $|q - p|_\Sigma$ denotes the intrinsic distance from $p$ to $q$ in $\Sigma$.


Conclude that the distance $|q - p_t|_W=|q - p|_\Sigma$
for any $t$.
It follows that the curve 
$$\gamma_t(\tau)=\left[
\begin{aligned}
&(\tau-t)\cdot\gamma'(\tau)&&\text{if}&&\tau< t;
\\
&\gamma(\tau)&&\text{if}&&\tau> t.
\end{aligned}
\right.$$
is a minimizing geodesic from $p_t$ to $q$ in the intrinsic metric of $W$. 

If $q$ is visible from $p_t$ for some $t$ then the line segment $[qp_t]$ intersects $\Sigma$ only at $q$.
From above, 
$\gamma_t$  coinsides with the line segment $[qp_t]$ which is impossible.

\parit{Comment.}
The problem appears in Milka's paper \cite{milka-geod}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{min-surf}.} 
\textit{A minimal surface.}
Without loss of generality we may assume that the sphere is centered at $0\in\RR^3$.

Consider the restriction $h$ of the function $x\mapsto |x|^2$ to the surface $\Sigma$.
Prove that $\Delta_\Sigma h\le 2$ and apply apply the divergence theorem for $\nabla_\Sigma h$.
It follows that the function
\[f\:r\mapsto \frac{\area(\Sigma\cap B_r(0))}{r^2}
\]
is non-decreasing in the interval $(0,1)$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
We described a partial case of so called \emph{monotonicity formula}.

Note that if we assume in addition that the surface is a disc,
then the statement holds for any saddle surface. 
Indeed, denote by $S_r$ the sphere of radius $r$ concentrated with the unit sphere. 
Then according to Problem~\ref{curve-in-S^2}, 
$\length \Sigma\cap S_r\ge 2\cdot\pi\cdot r$.
Then coarea formula leads to the solution.

On the other hand there are saddle surfaces homeomorphic to the cylinder
may have have arbitrary small area in the ball. 

If $\Sigma$ does not pass through the center and we only know the distance $r$ from center to $\Sigma$ then optimal bound is expected to be $\pi\cdot(1-r^2)$.
This is known if $\Sigma$ is topological disc, see \cite{alexander-osserman}.
An analogous result for area-minimizing submanifolds holds for dimensions and codimensions, see \cite{alexander-hoffman-osserman}.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{half-torus}.} 
\textit{Half-torus.}
Let $K$ be the convex hull of $\Omega'$.
Consider the boundary curve $\gamma'$ of $\partial K\cap \Omega'$ in $\Omega'$.

First note that the Gauss curvature of $\Omega'$ has to vanish at the points of $\gamma'$;
in other words, $\gamma'$ is the image of $\gamma$ under the length-preserving map.
Indeed since $\gamma'$ lies on convex part, 
the Gauss curvature at the points of $\gamma'$ has to be nonnegative. 
On the other hand $\gamma'$ bounds a flat disc in $\partial K$;
therefore its integral intrinsic curvature has to be $2{\cdot}\pi$.
If the Gauss curvature is positive at some point of $\gamma'$ then total intrinsic curvature of $\gamma'$ has to be $<2{\cdot}\pi$, a contradiction.

Assume that the asymptotic direction goes transversally to $\gamma'(t)$ at some point $\gamma'(t)$.
Show that $\gamma(t)\notin\partial K$.
It follows that $\gamma$ is an asymptotic curve of $\Omega'$.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that the length of $\gamma$ is $2{\cdot}\pi$ and its intrinsic curvature is $\equiv 1$.
Therefore, as the space curve,
$\gamma'$ has to be a curve with constant curvature $1$ and it should be closed.
Any such curve is congruent to a flat circle.

\parit{Comments.} It is not known if $\Omega'$ is congruent to $\Omega$.

The solution presented above is based on my answer 
to the question of O'Rourke, see \cite{rourke}.
Here are some related statements.
\begin{itemize}
\item Half-torus is second order rigid;
this was proved in
\cite{rembs} 
and \cite{efimov}.
\item Any second order rigid surface does not admit analytic deformation and for the surfaces of revolution, the assumption of analyticity can be removed. %REF???
\end{itemize}

\textit{Asymptotic line.}
Arguing by contradiction, assume that the projection $\bar\gamma$
of $\gamma$ on $x y$-plane is star shaped with respect to the origin.

Consider the function 
$$h(t)=(d_{\bar\gamma(t)}f)(\gamma(t)).$$
Prove that $h'(t)\ne 0$.
In particular $h(t)$ is a strictly monotonic function of $\mathbb{S}^1$, a contradiction.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{twisted-geodesic}.} 
\textit{Closed magnetic geodesics.}
Take $\Sigma$ to be a compact surface with constant curvature $-1$;
i.e., 
 $\Sigma=\HH^2/\Gamma$,
where $\HH^2$
is the hyperbolic plane 
and $\Gamma$ is a descrete subgroup of isometries of $\HH^2$ which acts freely.

Prove that $\Gamma$ contains only hyperbolic elements; i.e., any transformation $\gamma\in\Gamma$ fix two distinct points on the absolute.

Assume $\Sigma$ contains a closed curve with curvature $1$.
Note that this curve lifts to a horocycle in $\HH^2$.
Therefore $\Gamma$ has to contain an element which preserves this horocycle.
Such an element has to be parabolic;
i.e., it fixes a single point on the absolute of $\HH^2$,
 a contradiction.

The problem appears in the Ginzburg's paper \cite{ginzburg}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{torus}.}
\textit{Non contractable geodesics.}
Take a torus of revolution $T$;
the rotations of the circle produce a family closed geodesics which we will call \emph{meridians}.

Note that a geodesic on $T$ is either a meridian
or it is transversal to all the meridians.
Note that closed curve of these tipes can not be contractable.

$\measuredangle yxz>\pi-\tfrac1n$.

Prove that $\Omega_n$ 
is open and dense in $\mathfrak{C}$.
Finally note that the intersection
$\bigcap_n\Omega_n$
forms the subset of all smooth figures in $\mathfrak{C}$.

\textit{Rectifiable curve.}
The 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure will be denoted as $\mathcal{H}_1$. 

Set $L=\mathcal{H}_1(K)$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $K$ has diametr $1$.

Assume that $0<\eps<\tfrac12$.
Prove that 
\[\mathcal{H}_1(B_\eps(x)\cap K)\ge\eps\leqno(*)\]
for any $x\in K$.

Let $x_1,\dots, x_n$ be a maximal set of points in $K$ such that 
\[|x_i-x_j|\z\ge\eps\] for all $i\ne j$. 
From $(*)$ we have $n\le2\cdot L/\eps$.

Construct is a curve $\gamma_\eps$ such that (1) $\gamma_\eps$ is passing through all $x_i$, (2) $\length\gamma_\eps\le10\cdot L$ and (3) $\gamma_\eps$ lies in $\eps$-neighborhood of $K$.
We can assume that $\gamma_\eps$ is parametrized by length.

The needed curve can be obtained by passing to 
a partial limit of $\gamma_\eps$
 as $\eps\to 0$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Capture a sphere in a knot}.}
\textit{Capture a sphere in a knot.}
We can assume that the knot is given by a diagram on the the sphere.

Fix a M\"obius transformation $\mathbb{S}^2\to\mathbb{S}^2$.
Denote by $u$ its conformal factor. 
Since the M\"obius transformation preservs total area, 
we get 
$$\frac1{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2} u^2=1.$$ 
Therefore, 
$$\frac1{\area \mathbb{S}^2}\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^2} u<1.$$ 
It follows that after a suitable rotation of $\mathbb{S}^2$, 
the length of the knot decreases.

Similar argument gives a continuous one parameter family of M\"obius transformations which moves the knot in a hemisphere 
and allows the ball to escape. 

\parit{Comments.}
This is a question of Brady, see \cite{zeb}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{linked-circles}.}
\textit{Linked circles.} 
Fix a point $x\in\alpha$. 
Note that one can find another point $x'\in\alpha$ such that the interval 
$[xx']$ intersects $\beta$, say at the point $z$. 
Otherwise we can move each point of $\alpha$ along the line segment to $x$.
This deformation of $\alpha$ will not cross $\beta$;
the later contradicts that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are linked. 


Consider the curve $\alpha'$ which is the central projection of $\alpha$ 
from $z$ onto the unit sphere around $z$;
clearly
$$\length \alpha\ge \length\alpha'.$$

Note that $\alpha'$ passes through two antipodal points of the sphere;
therefore 
$$\length \alpha'\ge 2\cdot\pi.$$
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
This is the simplest case of so called \emph{Gehring's problem}. 
The solution above was given by Edelstein and Schwatz in \cite{edelstein-schwatz};
later the same solution was rediscovered few times.

Given a unit vector $u$, denote by $x_u$ the point on the inner curve
with outer normal vector $u$.
Draw a chord of outer curve which is tangent to the inner curve at $x_u$;
denote by $r=r(u)$ and $l=l(u)$ the lengths of this chord at the right and left from $x_u$.


Arguing by contradiction, assume $r(u)\ne l(u)$ for any $u\in\mathbb{S}^1$.
Since the functions $r$ and $l$ are continuous,
we can assume that 
$$r(u)>l(u)\ \ \text{for any}\ \ u\in\mathbb{S}^1.\leqno{({*})}$$

Prove that
each of the following two integrals 
\begin{align*}
\tfrac12\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^1}r^2(u)\cdot du
\quad\text{and}\quad
\tfrac12\cdot\int\limits_{\mathbb{S}^1}l^2(u)\cdot du
\end{align*}
give 
the area between the curves.
In particular 
the integrals are equal to eachother. 
The later contradicts $({*})$.

\parit{Comments.} This is a problem of Tabachnikov, see \cite{tabachnikob-mi}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Asymptotic geodesic}.}
\textit{Periodic asymptote.}
Assume contrary.
Passing to a finite cover, we can assume that the asymptote has no self intersections.
In this case 
the restriction $\gamma|_{[a,\infty)}$  
has no self-intersections if $a$ is large large enough.

Cut $\Sigma$ along $\gamma([a,\infty))$ and then cut from the obtained surface an infinite triangle $\triangle$ with two sides formed by both sides of cuts along $\gamma$; let us denote these sides of $\triangle$ by $\gamma_-$ and $\gamma_+$.
Note that 
\[\area\triangle<\area \Sigma<\infty\]
and both sides $\gamma_\pm$ 
form infinite minimizing geodesics in $\triangle$.

Consider the Buseman function $f$ for $\gamma_+$;
denote by $\ell(t)$ the length of the level curve $f^{-1}(t)$.
Let $-\kappa(t)$  be the total curvature of the suplevel set $f^{-1}([t,\infty))$.  
Note that for all large $t$ we have
\[\ell'(t)=\kappa(t)
\ \ \text{and}\ \ 
\kappa'(t)\le C\cdot \ell(t)^2\] 
where $C$ is a fixed constant.
The later implies that there is $\eps>0$ such that
\[\ell(t)\ge \frac\eps{t-a}\]
for any large $t$.
In particular,
\[\int\limits_a^\infty\ell(t)=\infty.\]
By coarea formula we get 
\[\area\triangle=\infty,\]
a contradiction.

\parit{Comment.}
I've learned the problem from Dmitri Burago and Sergei
Ivanov, it is originated from a discussions between
Keith Burns, Michael Brin and Yakov Pesin.

\parbf{\ref{Immersed surface}.}
\textit{Immersed surface.}
Let $\ell$ be a linear function which vanish on $\Pi$ and positive in $\Sigma$.

Let $z$ be a point of maximum of $\ell$ on $\Sigma$;
set $s_0=\ell(z)$.
Given $s<s_0$, denote by $\Sigma_s$ the connected component of $z$ in $\Sigma\cap\ell^{-1}([s,s_0])$.
Note that for all $s$ sufficiently close to $s_0$
we have
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Sigma_s$ is an embeded disc;
\item $\partial\Sigma_s$ is convex plane curve.
\end{itemize}

Applying open-close argument, we get that the same holds for all $s\in[0,s_0)$.

Since $\Sigma$ is connected, $\Sigma_0=\Sigma$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
This problem is a discussed in Gromov's lectures \cite{gromov-SGMC}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Two discs}.}
\textit{Two discs.}
Choose a continuous map $h\:\Sigma_1\to \Sigma_2$
which is identical on $\gamma$.
Let us prove that for some $p_1\in \Sigma_1$ and $p_2=h(p_1)\in \Sigma_2$
the tangent plane $\T_{p_1} \Sigma_1$ is parallel to the tangent plane $\T_{p_2} \Sigma_2$;
this is stronger than required.

Arguing by contradiction,
assume that such point does not exist.
Then for each $p\in\Sigma_1$
there is unique line $\ell_p\ni p$ 
which is parallel to each of the the tangent planes $\T_{p} \Sigma_1$ and $\T_{h(p)} \Sigma_2$.

Note that the lines $\ell_p$ form a tangent line distribution over $\Sigma_1$
and $\ell_p$ is tangent to $\gamma$ at any $p\in\gamma$.

Let $D$ be the disc in $\Sigma_1$ bounded by $\gamma$.
Consider the doubling of $D$ in $\gamma$;
it is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb S^2$.
The line distribution $\ell$ lifts to a line distribution on the doubling;
the later contradicts the hairy ball theorem.

\parit{Comments.} This proof was suggested nearly simultaneously by Steven Sivek and user damiano, see \cite{two-discs}.

Note that the same proof works in case if $\Sigma_i$ are oriented open surfaces such that $\gamma$ cuts a compact domain in each $\Sigma_i$.

There are examples of three disks $\Sigma_1$, $\Sigma_2$ and $\Sigma_3$
with common closed curve $\gamma$ such that there no triple of points $p_i\in\Sigma_i$ with parallel tangent plane.
Such examples can be found among ruled surfaces, see \cite{three-discs}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Simple geodesic}.} 
\textit{Simple geodesic.}
Let $\gamma$ be a two-sided infinite geodesic in $\Sigma$.
The following is the key statement in the proof.

\parbf{Claim.}
{\it The geodesic $\gamma$ contains at most one simple loop.}
\medskip

To prove the claim use the following observations.
\begin{itemize}
\item The total curvature $\omega$ of $\Sigma$ can not exceed $2\cdot\pi$.
\item If $\phi$ is the angle at the base of a simple geodesic loop then the total curvature surrounded by the loop equals to $\pi+\phi$.
\end{itemize}

Once the claim is proved, note that if a geodesic $\gamma$ has a self-intersection
then it contains a simple loop.
From above there is only one such loop;
it cuts a disc from $\Sigma$ 
and can go around it either clockwise or counterclockwise.
This way we divide all the self-intersecting geodesics 
into two sets which we will call \emph{clockwise} and \emph{counterclockwise}.

Note that the geodesic $t\mapsto \gamma(t)$ is clockwise 
if and only if 
$t\mapsto \gamma(-t)$
is counterclockwise.
The sets of clockwise and counterclockwise are open and the space of geodesics is connected. 
It follows that there are geodesics which neither clockwise nor counterclockwise;
by the definition, these geodesics have no self-intersections.

\parit{Comment.}
The claim in the proof 
appears in the Bangert's paper \cite[Corollary 2]{bangert}.

We get two discs with nonnegative curvature and large perimeter, 
say $\ell$.
Note that the area of each disc is bounded above by $a$.

Choose one of the discs $D$ and equip it with intrinsic metric.
Note that $D$ is non-negatively curved in the sense of Alexandrov.
Denote by $p$ and $q$ be the points in $D$ which lie on the maximal distance from each other.

Fix $\eps>0$.
Fix a geodesic $[pq]$ in $D$.
Show that if $\ell$ is large enough in terms of $\eps$ 
the distance from any point in $D$ to $[pq]$ is at most $\eps$
and the curvature of $\eps$-neighborhood of $p$ in $D$
is at least $\pi-\eps$.

By Gauss--Bonnet formula the total curvature of $\Sigma$ is $4\cdot\pi$.
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, we get that there are 4 point in $\Sigma$, each with curvature $\pi$
and remaining part of $\Sigma$ is flat.

It remains to show that any surface with this property is isometric to the surface of tetrahedron with equal opposite edges.
To do this cut $\Sigma$ along three geodesics which connect one singular point to the remaining three,
develop the obtained flat surface on the plane and think.

By Kirszbraun theorem, 
any short map $X\to \RR^2$ defined on $X\subset \RR^2$

In particular there is a short map $f\:\RR^2\to\RR^2$

An example can be found amond surfaces of the convex hulls $K$ of three broken lines,

Think that the broken lines $\gamma_i$ are very close to the line segment $[ab]$ 
and each edge of $\gamma_i$ appears as an edge of the convex hull.

For the right choice of the broken lines the minimizing geodesic $\sigma$ from $a$ to $b$ on the surface of $K$
has to cross $\gamma_i$ in the cyclic order in such a way 
that each edge of $\gamma_1$ is crossed.
It follows that $\sigma$ rotates aroung the line $ab$ more than 1000 times.

\parbf{\ref{Totally geodesic hypersurface}.} 
\textit{Totally geodesic hypersurface.}
Assume $\Sigma$ is a totally geodesic embedded hypersurface in $M$.
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $\Sigma$ is connected.

The complement $M\backslash\Sigma$ has one or two connected components.
Assume that the number of connected components is two, let us show that $M$ is homeomorphic to sphere.

Cut $M$ along $\Sigma$,
you get two manifolds with geodesic boundaries. 
Prove that the distance function to the boundary is convex in the interior of each manifold.
The distance function is not smooth but it can be smoothed while keeping it convex; this can be done by applying Greene--Wu Theorem (\cite[Theorem 2]{greene-wu}).
In particular it has singe critical point which is its maximum.

Applying Morse lemma, we get that each manifold is homeomorphic to a ball; 
hence $M$ 
is homeomorphic to the sphere.

If $M\backslash\Sigma$ is connected,
passing to a double cover of $M$ 
we reduce the problem to the case when the number of connected components is two.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Immersed convex hypersurface I}.} 
\textit{Immersed convex hypersurface {\rm I}.}
Observe first that any closed embedded locally convex hypersurface in a non-positively curved simply connected complete manifold bounds a convex region.


Let $\Sigma$ be immersed locally convex hypersurface in $M$.
Set 
\[m=\dim \Sigma=\dim M-1\]

Given a point in $p$ on $\Sigma$ 
denote by $p_r$ the point on distance $r$ from $p$
which lies on the geodesic starting from $p$ in the outer normal direction to $\Sigma$.
For fixed $r\ge 0$,
the points $p_r$ swap an immersed locally convex hypersurface which we denote by $\Sigma_r$.

Fix $z\in \Sigma$.
Denote by $S_r$ the sphere of radius $r$ centered at $z$.
Note that $S_r$ is diffeomorphic to $m$-dimensional sphere.

Denote by $d$ the diameter of $\Sigma$.
Note that for all $r>0$
any point on $\Sigma_r$
lies on the distance at most $d$ from $S_r$.
Conclude that for large $r$ the closest point projection $\phi_r\:\Sigma_r\to S_r$ is an immersion.


Since $\Sigma$ is connected
and $m\ge 2$, it follows that $\phi_r$ is a diffeomorphism for all large $r$.

By the observation above, $\Sigma_r$ bounds a convex region for all large $r$.
By open-close argument, the same holds for all $r\ge 0$.
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
The proof above appears in \cite{alexander}.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Immersed convex hypersurface II}.} 
\textit{Immersed convex hypersurface {\rm II}.}
Equip $\Sigma$ with the induced intrinsic metric.
Denote by $\kappa$ the lower bound for principle curvatures of $\Sigma$.
Note that we can assume that $\kappa>0$.

Fix sufficiently small $\eps=\eps(M,\kappa)>0$.
Given $p\in \Sigma$ consider the lift $\tilde h_p\:B_\eps(p)\to \T_{h(p)}$ along the exponential map $\exp_{h(p)}\:\T_{h(p)}\to M$.
More precisely
\begin{enumerate}
\item Connect each point $q\in B_\eps(p)\subset \Sigma$ to $p$
by a the minimizing geodesic  path $\gamma_q\:[0,1]\to \Sigma$
\item Consider the lifting $\tilde\gamma_q$ in $\T_{h(p)}$; this is the curve such that $\tilde\gamma_q(0)=0$ and $\exp_{h(p)}\circ\tilde\gamma_q(t)=\gamma_q(t)$ for any $t\in[0,1]$.
 \item Set $\tilde h(q)=\tilde\gamma_q(1)$.
\end{enumerate}
Show any  $\tilde h_p$ has principle curvatures at least $\tfrac\kappa2$.

Use the same idea as in problem~\ref{Immersed surface} to show that 
one can fix $\delta\z=\delta(M,\kappa)>0$ such that the restriction of $\tilde h_p|_{B_\delta(p)}$ is injective.
Conclude that the restriction $h|_{B_\delta(p)}$ is injective for any $p\in\Sigma$.

Now consider locally equidistant surfaces $\Sigma_t$ in the inward direction for small $t$. 
The principle curvatures of $\Sigma_t$ remain at least $\kappa$ in the barrier sense.
By the same argument as above, any $\delta$-ball in $\Sigma_t$
is embedded.

Applying open-close argument we get a one parameter family of locally convex locally equidistant surfaces $\Sigma_t$
for defined in a maximal interval $[0,a]$;
the surface $\Sigma_a$ degenerates to a point, say $p$. 

The point $p$ can be taken as the image of the center of the ball for the needed embedding $B\looparrowright M$
and 
the surfaces $\Sigma_t$ can be taken as the restrictions of the  embedding to the spheres.

As you see on the picture the statement does not hold in the two-dimensional case.

The proof presented above was indicated in Gromov's lectures \cite{gromov-SGMC};

A variation of this proof was obtained independently by Andrews in \cite{andrews};
instead of equidistant deformation

\parbf{\ref{almgren}.} 
\textit{Almgren's inequalities.}
Fix a  geodesic $m$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^m$ in $\mathbb{S}^n$.

Given $r\in (0,\tfrac\pi2]$,
denote by $U_r$ and $\tilde U_r$ the tubular $r$-neighbohood 
of $\Sigma$ and $\mathbb{S}^m$ in $\mathbb{S}^n$ correspondingly.

Note that 
\[U_{\frac\pi2}=\tilde U_{\frac\pi2}=\mathbb{S}^n.\leqno({*})\]

Prove that for any $x\in \partial U_r$ we have
\[H_r(x)\ge \tilde H_r,\] 
where $H_r(x)$ denotes the mean curvature of $\partial U_r$  at point $x$
and $\tilde H_r$ its mean curvature of $\partial\tilde U_r$.

Set 
\begin{align*}
a(r)&=\vol_{n-1} \partial U_r,
&
\tilde a(r)&=\vol_{n-1} \partial\tilde U_r,
\\
v(r)&=\vol_n U_r,
&
\tilde v(r)&=\vol_n \tilde U_r.
\intertext{by coarea formula,}
\tfrac d{dr} v(r)&= a(r),
&
\tfrac d{dr}\tilde v(r)&=\tilde a(r).
\end{align*}
for almost all $r$.
Note that
\begin{align*}
\tfrac d{dr}a(r)&\le \int\limits_{\partial U_r} H_r(x)\cdot d_x\vol_{n-1}\le
\\
&\le a(r)\cdot \tilde H_r
\intertext{and}
\tfrac d{dr}\tilde a(r)
&= \tilde a(r)\cdot \tilde H_r.
\intertext{It follows that}
\frac {v''(r)}{v(r)}&\le \frac {\tilde v''(r)}{\tilde v(r)}
\intertext{for almost all $r$. Therefore}
v(r)&\le\frac{\area\Sigma}{\area \mathbb{S}^m}\cdot \tilde v(r)
\end{align*}
for any $r>0$.

According to $({*})$, 
\[v(\tfrac\pi2)=\tilde v(\tfrac\pi2)=\vol\mathbb{S}^n.\]
Hence the result follows.

\parit{Comments.}
This problem is the most geometric part in the proof of Almgren's isoperimetric inequality \cite{almgren}.
The argument presented here is very similar to 
the proof of Gromov--Levy isometric inequality given in the Gromov's appendix to \cite{gromov-apendix}.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{codim=2}.} 
\textit{Hypercurve.}
Fix $p\in M$.
Denote by $s$ 
the second fundamental form of $M$ at $p$;
it is a symmetric bi-linear form on the tangent space $\T_pM$ of $M$ with values in the normal space $\N_pM$ to $M$, see page~\pageref{Second fundamental form}.
Note that the normal space $\N_pM$ is two-dimensional.

Prove that if sectional curvature of $M$ is positive, 
then
\[\<s(X,X),s(Y,Y)\> > 0\leqno({*})\]
for any pair of nonzero vectors $X,Y\in\T_pM$.

Show that $({*})$ implies that there is an orthonormal basis $e_1,e_2$ in $\N_pM$ 
such that the real-valued quadratic forms 
\begin{align*}
s_1(X,X)&=\<s(X,X),e_1\>,
&
s_2(X,X)&=\<s(X,X),e_2\>
\end{align*}
are positive definite.

Note that the curvature operators $R_1$ and $R_2$ defined by the following identity
\[R_{i}(X\wedge Y), V\wedge W\rangle 
=s_i(X,W)\cdot s_i(Y,V)-s_i(X,V)\cdot s_i(Y,W)\]
 are positive.
Finally, note that $R_{1}+R_{2}$ is the curvature operator of $M$ at $p$.

\parit{Comments.}
The problem appears in Weinstein's paper \cite{weinstein}.

Note that follows from \cite{micallef-moore}/\cite{boehm-wilking} it follows that
that the universal cover of $M$ is homeomorphic/diffeomorphic to a standard sphere.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Horosphere}.} 
\textit{Horosphere.}
Set 
$m=\dim \Sigma=\dim M-1$.

Let $b\:M\to\RR$ be the Busemann function such that $\Sigma=b^{-1}(\{0\})$.
Set  $\Sigma_r=b^{-1}(\{r\})$, so $\Sigma_0=\Sigma$.

Let us equip each $\Sigma_r$ with induced Riemannian metric.
Note that all $\Sigma_r$ have bounded curvature.
In particular, unit ball in $\Sigma_r$ has volume bounded above by universal constant, say $v_0$.
 

Given $x\in \Sigma$ denote by $\gamma_x$ 
the (necessary unique) unit-speed geodesic
such that $\gamma_x(0)=x$ and $b(\gamma_x(t))=t$ for any $t$.
Consider the map $\phi_{r}\:\Sigma\to\Sigma_r$ defined as
$\phi_r\:x\mapsto \gamma_x(r)$.

Notice that $\phi_r$ is a bi-Lipschitz map with the Lipschitz constants $e^{a\cdot r}$ and $e^{b\cdot r}$.
In particular, the ball of radius $R$ in $\Sigma$ is mapped by $\phi_r$
to a ball of radius $e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R$ in $\Sigma_r$.
Therefore
\[\vol_m B(x,R)_\Sigma\le e^{m\cdot b\cdot r}\cdot \vol_m B(x,e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R)_{\Sigma_r}\]
for any $R,r>0$.
Applying this formula in case $e^{a\cdot r}\cdot R=1$ implies that
\[\vol_m B(x,R)_\Sigma\le v_0\cdot R^{m\cdot \frac ba}.\]

\parit{Comment.}
The problem was suggested by Vitali Kapovitch.

There are examples of horospheres as above with degree of polynomial growth higher than $m$.
For example, consider the horosphere $\Sigma$ in the
the complex hyperbolic space 
of real dimension $4$.
Clearly $m=\dim \Sigma=3$ but the degree of its volume growth is $4$.
The later follows since $\Sigma$ admits has left-invariant metric on the Heizenber's group.

\parbf{\ref{Minimal spheres}.} 
\textit{Minimal spheres.}
Choose a pair of sufficiently close minimal spheres $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$,
say assume that the distance $a$ between $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ is strictly smaller than the injectivity radius of the manifold.
Note that in this case there is a bijection $\Sigma\to \Sigma'$, which will be denoted by $p\mapsto p'$ such that the distance $|p-p'|=a$ for any $p\in\Sigma$.

Let $\iota_p\:\T_p\to\T_{p'}$ be the parallel translation along the (necessary unique) minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $p'$.
Use hairy ball theorem 
to show that there is a pair $(p,p')$ such that $\iota_p(\T_p\Sigma)=\T_{p'}\Sigma'$.

Consider pairs of unit-speed geodesics $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ 
in $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$  
which start at $p$ and $p'$ correspondingly
and go in the parallel directions. 
Set $\ell(t)=|\alpha(t)-\alpha'(t)|$.

Use the second variation formula to show that $\ell''(0)$ has negative average for all directions from $p$. 
In particular $\ell''(0)<0$ for a pair $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ as above.
It follows that there are points $v\in\Sigma$ near $p$ 
and $v'\in\Sigma'$ near $p'$
such that 
\[|v-v'|<|p-p'|;\]
the later leads to a contradiction.

\parit{Comment.}
The problem was suggested by D. Burago,
it is related to Frankel's theorem on minimal surfaces; 
see \cite{frankel}.

It seems pleasurable that a 
compact 
positively curved 
4-dimensional manifold
can not contain a pair of equidistant spheres; if such pair exists, then the distance between them is at least the injectivity radius of the manifold.

Here is a short list of classical problems with similar solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item (Synge's problem \cite{synge})
{\it Any compact even-dimensional orientable manifold with strictly positive sectional curvature is
simply connected.}
\item (Frankel's problem \cite{frankel})
{\it Show that any two compact \hyperref[Minimal surface]{\emph{minimal hypersurfaces}} in a Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature must intersect.}
\item (Bochner's problem \cite{bochner}.){\it  Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold with negative Ricci curvature.
Prove that $(M,g)$ does not admit an isometric $\mathbb{S}^1$-action.}
\end{itemize}
The problem \ref{Totally geodesic immersion} can be considered as further development of this idea.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{\ref{Totally geodesic immersion}.} 
\textit{Totally geodesic immersion.}
Set $n=\dim N$ and $m=\dim M$.

Fix a smooth increasing concave function $\phi$.
Consider the function $f=\phi\circ\dist_N$.
Note that if $f$ is smooth at $x$ 
the the Hessian $\Hess_xf$ has at least $n+1$ negative eigenvalues.

Moreover, at any point $x\notin \iota(N)$ the same holds in the barrier sense;
i.e., there is a smooth function $h\ge f$ defined on $M$ of $x$
such that $h(x)=f(x)$ and $\Hess_xf$ has at least $n+1$ negative eigenvalues.

Use that $m< 2\cdot n$ and the property to prove the following
analog of Morse lemma for $f$.

\parbf{Claim.}
{\it Given $x\notin \iota(N)$ there is a neighborhood $U\ni x$ such that the set 
\[U_-=\set{z\in U}{f(z)<x}\] is simply connected.}

\medskip

Since $M$ is simply connected,
we can shrink by a disc $f_0\:\mathbb D\to M$ 
any closed curve in $\iota(N)$.
According to the claim, 
there is a homotopy $f_t\:\mathbb D\to M$, $t\in [0,1]$ 
such that $f_t(\partial \mathbb D)\subset \iota(N)$ for any $t$ and $f_1(\mathbb D)\subset \iota(N)$.
It follows that $\iota(N)$ is simply connected.

Finally, note that if $\iota(N)$ is simply connected 
then $\iota$ has to be an embedding.

The main idea in this proof was discovered by Wilking, 
see \cite{wilking-2003}.

Let $M$ be a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold with isometric $\mathbb{S}^1$-action.
Consider the quotient space $X=M/\mathbb{S}^1$.

Note that $X$ is a positively curved 3-dimensional Alexandrov space;
see \cite{akp} if in doubt.
In particular the angle $\measuredangle\hinge xyz$ between geodesics any two $[xy]$ and $[xz]$ is defined
and 
\[\measuredangle\hinge xyz+\measuredangle\hinge yzx+\measuredangle\hinge zxy> \pi.\leqno({*})\]
for any triangle $[xyz]$ formed by the minimizing geodesics $[xy]$, $[yz]$ and $[zx]$ in $X$.

Assume $p\in X$ corresponds to a fixed point of $\mathbb{S}^1$-action.
Show that 
for any three geodesics $[px]$, $[py]$ and $[pz]$ in $X$ we have
\[\measuredangle\hinge xpy+\measuredangle\hinge ypz+\measuredangle\hinge zpx\le \pi.\leqno({*}{*})\]

Arguing by contradiction,
assume that there are 4 fixed points $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ and $q_4$.
Connect each pair $q_i\ne q_j$ by a minimizing geodesic $[q_iq_j]$.

Denote by $\omega$ the sum of all 12 angles of the type  $\measuredangle\hinge{q_i}{q_j}{q_k}$.
By $({*})$, we have
\[\omega>4\cdot\pi.\]
By $({*}{*})$ at each vertex $q_i$, we have 
\[\omega\le 4\cdot\pi,\]
a contradiction.

\parbf{\ref{scalar-curv}.} 
\textit{Scalar curvature vs. injectivity radius.}
We will prove that if the injectivity radius of the manifold $(M,g)$ is at least $\pi$
then the average of sectional curvatures on $(M,g)$ is at most $1$.
This is stronger than required.

Fix a point $p\in M$ and two orthonormal vectors $U,V\in\T_p M$.
Consider the geodesic $\gamma$ in $M$ such that $\dot\gamma(0)=U$.

Set $U_t=\dot\gamma(t)\in \T_{\gamma(t)}$ 
and let $V_t\in \T_{\gamma(t)}$ be the parallel translation of $V=V_0$ along $\gamma$.

Consider the field $W_t=\sin t\cdot V_t$ on $\gamma$.
Set 
\begin{align*}
\gamma_\tau(t)&=\exp (\tau\cdot W_t),
&
\ell(\tau)&=\length(\gamma_\tau|_{[0,\pi]}),
&
q(U,V)&=\ell''(0).
\end{align*}
Note that
\[q(U,V)=\int\limits_{0}^\pi [(\cos t)^2-K(U_t,V_t)\cdot (\sin t)^2]\cdot dt,\leqno({*})\]
where $K(U,V)$ denotes the curvature 
in the sectional direction spanned by $U$ and $V$. 

Denote by $s$ and $k$ the avarage values of $q(U,V)$ and $K(U,V)$.

Since any geodesics of length $\pi$ is minimizing,
we get $q(U,V)\ge0$ for any pair of orthonormal vectors $U$ and $V$.
In particular, $s\ge 0$.

Let us take average value of right hand side in $({*})$.
By Liouville's theorem we can switch the order of integrals;
therefore  $s=\tfrac\pi2\cdot(1-k)$.
Hence the result follows.

\[|p^{k\cdot v}-q^{k'\cdot w}|_M^2<|p-q|_M^2+ (k-k')^2

assuming $|k|,|k'|\le \delta$.

Choose $p$ and $v \in \nu_p$ so that $r=|p-p^{\delta\cdot v}|$ 
takes the maximal possible value.
From $({*}{*})$ it follows that $r>0$.

Let $\gamma$ be the extension of unit-speed minimizing geodesic from $p_v$ to $p$;
denote by $v_t$ the parallel translation of $v$ to $\gamma(t)$ along $\gamma$. 

We can choose the parameter of $\gamma$ so that $p=\gamma(0)$, $p^v=\gamma(-r)$.
Set $p_n=\gamma(n\cdot r)$, so $p=p_0$ and $p^v=p_{-1}$, 
Fix large integer $N$ and set $w_n=(1-\tfrac nN)\cdot v_{n\cdot r}$
and $q_n=p_n^{w_n}$.

From $({*}{*}{*})$, there is a constant $C$ independent of $N$ such that
\[|q_k-q_{k+1}|<r+\tfrac C{N^2}\cdot\delta^2.\]
Therefore 
\[|q_{k+1}-p_{k+1}|>|q_k-p_k|-\tfrac C{N^2}\cdot\delta^2.\]
By induction, we get 
\[|q_N-p_N|>r-\tfrac C{N}\cdot\delta^2.\]
Since $N$ is large we get
\[|q_N-p_N|>0.\]
By $({*})$ we get $q_N=p_N^0=p_N$, a contradiction.

\textit{Minkowski space.}
Fix increasing function $\phi\:(0,r)\to \RR$
such that $\phi''+(n-1)\cdot(\phi')^2+C=0$.
Note that if $\Ric_M\ge C$ then the function 
$x\mapsto\phi(|p-x|_M)$ is subharmonic.
In particular, for arbitrary array of points $p_i$ and positive reals $\lambda_i$ the function 
$$f(x)=\sum_i\lambda_i\cdot\phi(|p_i-x|_M).$$

It remains to show that if $p\ne 2$ then there is an array

such that the function 
$$f(x)=\sum_i\lambda_i\cdot\phi(|p_i-x|_M)$$
has strict local minimum.

\parit{Comment.} The argument given here is very close to the proof of Abresch--Gromoll inequality, see \cite{abresch-gromoll}.

\textit{Curvature hollow.}
Construct a metric that the connected sum
$M=\RR^3\#\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^1$ admits a metric which is flat outside a compact set and has non positive scalar curvature.
Further, note that such metric can be constructed in such a way that it has a closed geodesic $\gamma$ with trivial holonomy and with constant negative curvature in its a tubular neighborhood.

Cut the tubular neigbourhood $D^2\times \mathbb{S}^1$ of $\gamma$, 
prepare a metric $g$ on $\mathbb{S}^1\times D^2$ with negative scalar curvature which 
is identical to the original metric near the boundary.
The needed patch $(\mathbb{S}^1\times D^2,g)$ can be found among wrap products $\mathbb{S}^1\times_f D^2$.

Note that after the surgery we get a manifold diffeomorphic to $\RR^3$, it flat outside of compact set and has negative scalar curvature somewhere.

\parit{Comments.}
This construction was given by Lohkamp in \cite{lohkamp}.
Hollows with negative Ricci curvature also exist, see ???.
On the other hand there are no hollows with positive scalar curvature;

Fir $\eps>0$ such that there is unique geodesic between any two points on distance $<\eps$ from the origin of $\RR^3$.

Consider three points $a$, $b$ and $c$ 
on the coordinate lines which are $\eps$-close 
to the origin.

Prove that the angles of the triangle $\triangle abc$
coincide with its model angles.
It follows that there is a flat geodesic triangle in $(\RR^3,g)$ with vertex at $a$, $b$ and $c$.

Use the family of constructed flat triangles 
to show that at any $x$ point in the $\tfrac\eps{10}$-neighborhood of the origin
the sectional curvature 
vanish in an open set of sectional directions.
The later implies that the curvature is identically zero 
in this neighborhood.

Moving the origin and apply the same argument we get that the curvature is identically zero everywhere.
Hence the result follows.

\textit{Two-convexity.}
Assume $W$ is a hypersurface of needed type.

\parit{Morse-style solution.}
Let us equip $\RR^4$ with $(x,y,z,t)$-coordinates.

Consider a generic linear function $\ell\:\RR^4\to\RR$
which is close to the sum of coordinates $x+y+z+t$.
Note that $\ell$
has non-degenerate critical points on $W$ and all its critical values are different.

Consider the sets 
$$W_s=\set{w\in \RR^4\backslash K}{\ell(w)<s}.$$
Note that $W_{-1000}$ contains a closed curve, say $\alpha$, 
which is contactable in $\RR^4\backslash K$, 
but not constructable in the set $W_{-1000}$.

Set $s_0$ to be the infimum of the values $s$ such that
the $\alpha$ is contactable in $W_s$.

Note that $s_0$ is a critical value of $\ell$ on $W$;
denote by $p_0$ the corresponding critical point.
By 2-convexity of $\RR^4\backslash K$,
the index of $p_0$ has to be at most $1$.
On the other hand, since the disc hangs at this point,
its index has to be at least $2$,
 a contradiction.

\parit{Alexandrov-style proof.}
Fix a constant Riemannian metric $g$ on $\RR^4$.
According to the main result of Alexander Bishop and Berg in \cite{ABB}, $X_g=(\RR^4\backslash (\Int K),g)$ has nonpositive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
In particular the universal cover of $\tilde X_g$ of $X_g$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space.

By rescaling $g$ and passing to the limit we obtain that universal Riemannian cover $Z_g$ of $(\RR^4,g)$ branching in the coordinate planes is a $\CAT[0]$ space.
Show that $Z_g$ is $\CAT[0]$ space if and only if the two planes are orthogonal with respect to $g$;
the later leads to a contradiction.

\parit{Comments.}
Note that the closed $1$-neighborhood of these two planes has two-convex complement, but the boundary of this neighborhood is not smooth.

The Morse-style is closely related 
to Gromov's lectures \cite[\S$\sfrac{1}{2}$]{gromov-SGMC}.

\textit{Minimal foliation.}
First show that there is a self-dual harmonic 2-form on $(\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2,g)$;
i.e., a 2-form $\omega$ such that $d\omega=0$ and $\star\omega=\omega$,
where $\star$ denotes the Hodge star operator.

Fix $p\in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.
Use the identity $\star\omega_p=\omega_p$
to show that
there is a real number $\lambda_p$ and the isometry $\mathrm{J}_p\:\T_p\to\T_p$ 
such that
$\mathrm{J}_p\circ\mathrm{J}_p =-\id$ 
and 
$\omega(X,Y)=\lambda_p\cdot g(X,\mathrm{J}_pY)$ for any $X,Y\in \T_p$.

Consider canonical symplectic form $\omega_0$ on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$;
that is sum of pullbacks of volume forms on $\mathbb{S}^2$  
for the two projections $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2\to \mathbb{S}^2$.
Note that for the canonical metric on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$,
the form $\omega_0$ is harmonic and self-dual. 
Since $g$ is close to the standard metric,
we can assume that $\omega$ is close to $\omega_0$.
In particular $\lambda_p\ne0$ for any $p\in \mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$.

It follows that $\omega$ defines simplectic structure on $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{S}^2$
and $\mathrm{J}$ is its psudocomplex structure.
It remains to take the pseudoholomorphic surfaces in the homology classes of $\mathbb{S}^2\times x$ and $x\times \mathbb{S}^2$ for some fixed $x\in\mathbb{S}^2$.

Prove that

Note that
\[\vol(\RP^n,g)=\vol(\RP^n,g_{\mathrm{can}})\cdot\oint\limits_{\RP^n}\lambda^n\cdot d\vol_{\mathrm{can}}.\]
By H\"older's inequality, we have
\[\left(\,\,\oint\limits_{\RP^n}\lambda\cdot d\vol_{\mathrm{can}}\right)^n

Clearly $\vol T^1M$ is finite.

Note that 
there is a nonempty bounded open set $U\subset \T^1 M$
such that $df(u)>\eps$ for any $u\in U$ and some fixed $\eps>0$.

Denote by $\phi^t$ the geodesic flow on $\T^1 M$.
Given $u\in U$,
consider the function $h\:t\mapsto f\circ\tau\circ\phi^t(u)$.
Note that $h'(t)>\eps$ for any $t\ge 0$.

Prove that there is an infinite sequence of positive reals $t_1,t_2,\dots$
such that 
$$\phi^{t_i}(U)\cap\phi^{t_j}(U)=\emptyset$$

An example of $D$ can be guessed from the picture. 

Take the product $D\times D\subset \RR^4$;
it is homeomorphic to a 4-dimensional ball.
Note that 
$$\vol_3[\partial(D\times D)]=2\cdot\area D\cdot\length \partial D<20\cdot\eps.$$
The boundary $\partial(D\times D)$ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^3$

Equip $\RR^4$ with $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)$-coordinates
so that 
\[\omega=dx_1\wedge dy_1+dx_2\wedge dy_2\]
is the symplectic form. 

The embedding will be given as a composition of a linear symplectomorphism $\lambda$ 
with the quotient map $\phi\:\RR^4\to \TT^2\times\RR^2$ by the integer $(x_1,y_1)$-lattice.
Clearly $\phi\circ\lambda$ preserves the symplectic structure,
it remains to find $\lambda$ such that the restriction $\phi\circ\lambda|_\Omega$
is injective.

Without loss of generality,
we can assume that $\Omega$ is a ball centered at the origin.
Choose an oriented 2-dimensional subspace $V$ subspace of $\RR^4$ 
such that the integral of $\omega$ over 
$\Omega\cap V$ is small positive number, say $\tfrac\pi4$. 

Note that there is a linear symplectomorphism $\lambda$
 which maps planes parallel to $V$ to planes
parallel to the $(x_1,y_1)$-plane, 
and that maps the disk $V\cap\Omega$ to a disk.
It follows that the the intersection of $\lambda(\Omega)$ 
with any plane parallel to the $(x_1,y_1)$-plane is equal to a disk of radius at most $\tfrac 12$.
In particular $\phi\circ\lambda|_\Omega$
is injective.

\parit{Comments.}
This construction is given by Guth in \cite{guth-symplectic}
and attributed to Leonid Polterovich.

Note that according to Gromov's theorem, analogous statement with $\CC\times \DD$ as the target does not hold, here $\DD\subset \CC$ is the open disc with incuced symplectic structure.
In particular,
the projection of $\lambda(\Omega)$ as above

can not be made arbitrary small.

Let $h$ be the pullback metric on $M$ for $f\:M\to N$.
Clearly $h\ge g$.

Let us denote by $\N M$ and $\T M$ the normal and tangent bundle of $M$ in $\RR^n$.

Consider the the normal exponential map $\exp_M\:\N M\to\RR^n$
and denote by $J_V$ its Jacobian at $V\in \N_pM$.
Note that for all small $\eps>0$, we have
\[\vol B_\eps(M)=\int\limits_M d_p\vol_m\cdot\int\limits_{B_r\subset \N_pM}J_V\cdot d_V\vol_{n-m}.\leqno{({*})}\]

Set $m=\dim M$.
Given $p\in M$, 
denote by $s_p\:\T_p\times \T_p\to \N_p$
the \hyperref[Second fundamental form]{second fundamental form} of $M$.
Recall that the curvature tensor of $M$ at $p$ can be expressed the following way
\[R_p(X\wedge Y), V\wedge W\rangle 
=\langle s_p(X,W), s_p(Y,V)\rangle-\langle s_p(X,V), s_p(Y,W)\rangle.\]

Given $V\in \N_p M$,
express $J_V$ in terms of $\<s_p(X,Y),V\>$.
Show that for small $r$ the integral
\[v(r)=\int\limits_{B_r\subset \N_pM}J_V\cdot d_V\vol_{n-m}\]
is a polynomial 
of $r$ and its coefficients can be expressed in terms of the curvature tensor $R_p$.

It follows that the right hand side in $({*})$ can be expressed in terms of curvature tensor of $M$.
The problem follows since the curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of metric tensor of $M$.

\textit{Disc.}
Show that given a positive integer $n$ one can construct a tree $T$ embeddded into the disc such that any homotopy of the boundary of the disc to a point pass through a curve which intersects $n$ different edges.
(For the tree on the diagram $n=3$.)

Fix small $\eps>0$, say $\eps=\tfrac1{10}$.
Consider the disc with embedded tree $T$ as above.
We will construct a metric on the disc 
with diameter and length of its boundary below $1$
such that 
the distance between any two edges of $T$ of without common vertex 
is at least $\eps$ .

To construct such a metric, first fix a metric on the cylinder $\mathbb S^1\times [0,1]$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item The $\eps$-neighborhoods of the boundary components are product metrics.
\item Any vertical sigment $x\times[0,1]$ has length $\tfrac 12$.
\item One of the boundary component is $\eps$-long.
\item The other boundary component has length $2\cdot m\cdot \eps$, 
where $m$ is the number of edges in $T$.
\end{itemize}
Equip $T$ with a metric so that each edge has length $\eps$
and glue the long boundary component of the cylinder to $T$ by piecewise isometry so that the resulting space is homeomorphic to disc and the tree corresponds to it-self.

According to the first construction,
for any null-homotopy of the boundary 
the least length is at least $n\cdot\tfrac{\eps}{10}$.
The obtained metric is not Riemannian, but is is easy to smooth.
Since $n$ is arbitrary the result follows.

\textit{Shortening homotopy.}
Set $p=\gamma_0(0)$ and $\ell_0=\length\gamma_0$.

By compactness argument,
there exists $\delta>0$ 
such that no geodesic loops based at $p$ with has length in the interval $(L-D, L+D+\delta]$. 

Assume $\ell_0\ge L+\delta$.
Choose $t_0\in [0,1]$ such that
\[\length\gamma_0|_{[0,t_0]}=L+\delta\]
Let $\sigma$ be a the minimizing geodesic from $\gamma(t_0)$
to $p$.
Note that $\gamma_0$ is homotopic to the joint 
\[\gamma_0'=\gamma_0|_{[0,t_0]}*\sigma*\bar\sigma*\gamma|_{[t_0,1]},\]
where $\bar\sigma$ denotes the backward parametrization of $\sigma$.

Consider the loop $\lambda_0$ at $p$
formed by joint of $\gamma|_{[0,t_0]}$ and $\sigma$.
Applying a curve shortening process to $\lambda_0$, 
we get a curve shortening homotopy $\lambda_t$
rel. its ends 
from the loop $\lambda_0$ to a geodesic loop $\lambda_1$ at $p$.
From above, 
\[\length\lambda_1\le L-D.\]

The joint $\gamma_t=\lambda_t*\bar\sigma*\gamma|_{[t_0,1]}$
is a homotopy
from $\gamma_0'$ to an other curve $\gamma_1$.
From the construction it is clear that 
\begin{align*}
 \length \gamma_t&\le \length \gamma_0+2\cdot \length\sigma\le
 \\
 &\le \length \gamma_0+2\cdot D
\end{align*}
for any $t\in[0,1]$
and 
\begin{align*}
 \length \gamma_1&=\length\lambda_1+\length\sigma+\length\gamma|_{[t_0,1]}\le
\\ &\le L-D+D+\length\gamma-(L+\delta)=
\\ &=\ell_0 -\delta.
\end{align*}
Repeating the procedure few times we get we get curves $\gamma_2$, $\gamma_3,\dots,\gamma_n$
joint by the needed homotopies so that 
$\ell_{i+1}\le\ell_i-\delta$ and $\ell_n< L+\delta$,
where $\ell_i=\length\gamma_i$.

If $\ell_n\le L$, we are done.
Otherwise repeat the argument once more for $\delta'=\ell_n-L$.

\textit{Geodescic hypersurface.}
Let $r$ be the maximal distance from points in $W$ to $M$.

Fix a fine triangulation of $W$ 
so that $M$ becomes a subcomplex.
Say, let us assume that the diameter of each simplex in $\tau$ is less than 
$\eps$.
We can assume that $\tau$ is a barycentric subdivision of an other triangulation, so all the vertices of $\tau$ can be colored into colors $(0,\dots, m+1)$
such that the vertices of each simplex 
get different colors.
Denote by $\tau_i$ the $i$-dimensional subcomplex of $\tau$ formed by all vertices with colors $(0,\dots, i)$.

For each vertex $v$ in $\tau$ 
choose a point $v'\in M$ on the distance $\le r$.
Note that if $v$ and $w$ are the vertices of one simplex then
\[|v'-w'|_M<2\cdot r+\eps.\]

If $\tfrac{i_M}{2\cdot(m+1)}>r$, we can assume that $\eps<\tfrac{i_M}{2\cdot(m+1)}-r$.
It makes possible to extend the map $v\mapsto v'$ 
to a continuous 
map $W\to M$.
The map is already defined on $\tau_0$,
using the cone construction we can extend it to $\tau_1$;
we can do this since the distance between vertices in one simplex are below injectivity radius of $M$.
Repeat the cone construction recursively,
to extend the map $\tau_{m+1}=\tau$
(some distance estimate are needed here).

It follows that fundamental class of $M$ vanish in the homology ring of $M$, 
a contradiction.

\textit{Noncontracting map.}
Given any pair of point $x_0,y_0\in K$, 
consider two sequences $x_0,x_1,\dots$ and $y_0,y_1,\dots$
such that 
and $x_{n+1}=f(x_n)$ and $y_{n+1}=f(y_n)$ for each $n$.

Since $K$ is compact, 
we can choose an increasing sequence of integers $n_k$
such that both sequences $(x_{n_i})_{i=1}^\infty$ and $(y_{n_i})_{i=1}^\infty$
converge.
In particular, both of these sequences  are Cauchy;
i.e.,
\[
|x_{n_i}-x_{n_j}|_K, |y_{n_i}-y_{n_j}|_K\to 0
\ \ 
\text{as}
\ \ \min\{i,j\}\to\infty.
\]


Since $f$ is noncontracting, we get
\[
|x_0-x_{|n_i-n_j|}|
\le 
|x_{n_i}-x_{n_j}|.
\]

It follows that  
there is a sequence $m_i\to\infty$ such that
\[
x_{m_i}\to x\ \ \text{and}\ \ y_{m_i}\to y\ \ \text{as}\ \ i\to\infty.
\leqno({*})\]

Set \[\ell_n=|x_n-y_n|_K,\]
where $|{*}-{*}|_K$ denotes the distance between points in $K$.
Since $f$ is noncontracting, $(\ell_n)$ is a nondecreasing sequence.

By $({*})$, it follows that $\ell_{m_i}\to\ell_0$ as $m_i\to\infty$.
It follows that $(\ell_n)$ is a constant sequence.

In particular 
\[|x_0-y_0|_K=\ell_0=\ell_1=|f(x_0)-f(y_0)|_K\]
for any pair of points $(x_0,y_0)$ in $K$.
I.e., $f$ is distance preserving, in particular injective.

From $({*})$, we also get that $f(K)$ is everywhere dense.
Since $K$ is compact $f\:K\to K$ is surjective. Hence the result follows.

This is a basic lemma in the introduction to Gromov--Hausdorff distance;

\parbf{\ref{compact}.} 
\textit{Embedding of a compact.}
Let $K$ be a compact metric space.
Denote by $B(K)$ the space of bounded functions on $K$
equipped with sup norm; 
i.e., 
\[|f|=\sup_{x\in K}|f(x)|.\]

Note that the map $\phi\:K\to B(K)$, defied by $x\mapsto \dist_x$
is a distance preserving embedding.

Denote by $W$ the linear convex hull of the image $\phi(K)\subset B(K)$ with the metric induced from $B(K)$.
It remains to show that $W$ forms a compact length space.

\parit{Comment.}
The map $\phi$ is called \emph{Kuratowski embedding},
although it was essentially discovered by Fr\'echet in the same paper he introduced metric spaces.

Assume contrary, let $(\mathbb{S}^2,g)$ is sufficiently close to $B^2$.

Choose a closed simple curve $\gamma$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$ which is close to the boundary of $B^2$.
Choose two points $p_1$ and $p_2$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$ 
on the opposite sides of $\gamma$ which are sufficiently close to the center of $B^2$.

On one had $p_1$ and $p_2$ have to be close in $\mathbb{S}^2$.
On the other hang, to get from $p_1$ to $p_2$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$,
one has to cross $\gamma$.
Hence the distance from $p_1$ to $p_2$ in $\mathbb{S}^2$ has to be close to $2$,

Make fine burrows in the standard 3-ball which do not change its topology,

Consider the doubling of obtained ball in its boundary.
Clearly the obtained space is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^3$.
prove that the burrows can be made 
so that it is sufficiently close to the original ball 
in the Gromov--Hausdorff metric.

It remains to smooth the obtained space slightly

Choose a point $p\in M$,
denote by $f$ the distance function from $p$.

Let us cover $M$ by the connected components of the preimages 
$f^{-1}((n-1,n+1))$.
Clearly any point in $M$ is covered by at most two such components.
It remains to show that each of these components has diameter less than $100$.

Assume contrary; let $x$ and $y$ be two points in such connected component 
and $|x-y|_M\ge 100$.
Connect $x$ to $y$ by a curve $\tau$ in the component.
Consider the closed curve $\sigma$ formed by two geodesics $[px]$, $[py]$ and $\tau$.

Prove that $\sigma$ can be divided into 4 arcs $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$
in such a way that the minimal distance from $\alpha$ to $\gamma$ as well as the minimal distance from $\beta$ to $\delta$ is at least $10$.

Use the last statement to show that $\sigma$ 
can not be shrank

\parbf{\wrenches\ref{weird-metric}.} 
\textit{No short embedding.}
Let $c_0,c_1,\dots,c_n$ be a chain of disjoint circles in $\RR^3$;
i.e., $c_i$ and $c_{i-1}$ are linked for each $i$. 
Assume that $\RR^3$ is equipped with a length-metric $d$,
such that the total length of the circles is $\ell$.

Note that for any short homeomorphism $f\:(\RR^3,d)\to\RR^3$ the distance from $f(c_0)$ to $f(c_n)$ is at most $\ell$.

Fix a line segment $[ab]$ in $\RR^3$.
Modify the metric on $\RR^3$ in arbitrary small neighbohood of $[ab]$
so that there is a chain going along $\II$ as above 
with arbitrary small total length $\ell$,
but at the same time the obtained metric is arbitrary close to the canonical; i.e.,
\[|d(x,y)-|x-y||<\eps\]
for any two points $x,y\in\RR^3$
and fixed in advanced small $\eps>0$.

Now choose a converging sequence of line sgmments $[a_nb_n]\to [a_\infty b_\infty]$
and apply the above construction in nonoverlaping neighborhood of $[a_nb_n]$ 
and for a sequence $\eps_n$ which converges to zero very fast.

Note that for the obtainded lenght metric $d$,
the space $(\RR^3,d)$ does not admit 
a short homeomorphuism to $\RR^3$.
Indeed, if such homeomorphism $h$
exists then 
from the above construction,
we get 
\[|h(a_\infty)-f(b_\infty)|\le \ell_n+\eps_n+\eps_{n+1}+\dots.\]
The right hand side converges to $0$ as $n\to\infty$.
Therefore $h(a_\infty)=f(b_\infty)$, a contradiction.

Prove that there is a nondecreasing sequence of Riemannian meric tensors
$g_0\le g_1\le ...$ such that the induced metrics converge to the given sub-Riemannian metrics.
The metric $g_0$ can be assumed to be a metric on round sphere.

Applying the construction as in Nash--Kuiper theorem,
one can produce a sequence of smooth embedings $h_n\:\mathbb{S}^n\to \RR^{n+1}$ with the induced metrics $g_n'$
such that $|g_n'-g_n|\to 0$.

Moreover, assume we assign a positive real number $\eps(h)$ for any smooth embedding $h\:\mathbb{S}^n\to\RR^{n+1}$.
Then we can assume that 
\[|h_{n+1}(x)-h_n(x)|<\eps(h_n)\] for any $x\in \mathbb{S}^n$ and $n$.
Choosing $\eps(h_n)$ sufficiently small guarantees that $h_n$ converges to say $h_\infty$ 
and the metric induced by $h_\infty$ coincides with the given sub-Riemannian metric.

\parit{Comments.} 
The original papers of Nash \cite{nash} and Kuiper \cite{kuiper} are very readable.

\textit{Length preserving map.}
Assume there is a length-preserving map $f\:\RR^2\to \RR$.
Note that $f$ is Lipschitz.
Therefore by Rademacher's theorem, $f$ is differentiable almost everywhere.

Fix a unit vector $u$.
Prove that, for almost all $x$, the length of curve 
$\alpha\:t\mapsto x+t\cdot u$, $t\in[0,1]$ can be expressed as the integral
\[\int\limits_0^1 (d_{\alpha(t)}f)(u) \cdot dt.\]

It follows that $|d_xf(v)|=|v|$ for almost all $x,v\in\RR^2$;
in particular $d_xf$ is defined and has rank 2 at some point $x$, a contradiction.

Without loss of generality, we can assume that $b+a=0$.

Consider the sequence of isometries $f_0$, $f_1,\dots$ defined recursively
\[f_{n+1}(x)= -f_n^{-1}(-f_n(x))\]
with $f_0=f$.
Note that $f_n(a)=a$ and $f_n(b)=b$ for any $n$ and 
$$|f_{n+1}(0)|=2\cdot|f_n(0)|.$$
The later condition implies that if $f(0)\ne 0$
then $|f_n(0)|\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$.
On the other hand, since $f_n$ is isometry and $f(a)=a$,
we get $|f_n(0)|\le 2\cdot |a|$, a contradiction.

\parit{Comment.}
Note that the problem is not trivial since in general
metric midpoint of $a$ and $b$ in $(\RR^n,d)$ 
are not defined uniquely.

The solution above
is the main step in the V\"ais\"al\"a's proof of Mazur--Ulam theorem;
it states that any isometry $(\RR^n,d)\to (\RR^n,d)$ has to be an affine.

Show that $\rho$ is a metric

From uniqueness of straight segment between given points in $\RR^m$,
it follows that any straight line in $\RR^m$ forms a geodesic in $(\RR^m,\rho)$.

Set 
\[\|\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}=\rho(\bm{x},(\bm{x}+\bm{v})).\]
Note that 
\[ \|\lambda\cdot\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}
=
|\lambda|\cdot\|\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}\]
for any $\bm{x},\bm{v}\in\RR^m$ and $\lambda\in\RR$.

Prove that 
\[

\Const\cdot |\bm{x}-\bm{x'}|\]
for any $\bm{x},\bm{x'},\bm{v}\in\RR^m$, 
$\lambda\in\RR$
and some fixed $\Const\in\RR$.
Passing to the limit as $\lambda\to\infty$, 
we get
$\|\bm{v}\|_{\bm{x}}$ does not depend on $\bm{x}$;
hence the result follows.

\parbf{\ref{hom-near-QI}.} 
\textit{A homeomorphism near quasi-isometry.}
Let $M\ge 1$ and $A\ge 0$.
Define $(M,A)$-quasi-isometry
as a map $f\:X\to Y$ between metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that 
\[\tfrac1M\cdot |x-y|-A\le |f(x)-f(y)|\le M\cdot |x-y|+A\]
and any point in $Y$ lies on the distance at most $A$ from a point in the immage $f(X)$.

Note that $(M,0)$-quasi-isometry is a $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map.
Moreover,
if $f_n\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ is a  $(M,\frac1n)$-quasi-isometry 
for each $n$ then any partial limit of $f_n$ as $n\to\infty$
is a $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map.

It follows that given $M\ge 1$ and $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that 
for any $(M,\delta)$-quasi-isometry $f\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ and any $p\in \RR^m$
there is an $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map $h\:B_1(p)\to \RR^m$
such that
\[|f(x)-h(x)|<\eps\]
for any $x\in B_1(p)$.

Applying recaling, we can get the following equivalent formulation. 
Given $M\ge 1$, $A\ge 0$ and $\eps>0$
there is big enough $R>0$ such that for any $(M,A)$-quasi-isometry 
$f\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ and any $p\in\RR^m$ there is a $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map $h\:B_R(p)\to \RR^m$
such that 
\[|f(x)-h(x)|<\eps\cdot R\]
for any $x\in B_R(p)$.

Now cover $\RR^m$ by balls
$B_R(p_n)$, construct a $[\tfrac1M,M]$-bi-Lipschitz map $h_n\:B_R(p_n)\to \RR^m$ for each $n$.
The maps $h_n$ are close to $f$ on $B_R(p_n)$.

It remains to deform slightly each $h_n$ so that they agree on the overlaps.
This can be done by Siebenmann' Theorem, see \cite{siebenmann}.
If instead you apply Sulivan's theorem, you get a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism $h\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$,
see \cite{sulivan} or \cite{tukia-vaisala}.

\textit{Piecewise Euclidean quotient.}
Note that the group $\Gamma$ serves as holonomy group of the quotient space $P=\RR^n/\Gamma$ with the induced polyhedral metric.
More precisely, one can identify $\RR^n$ with the tangent space of a regular point $x_0$ of $P$ in such a way that
for any $\gamma\in\Gamma$ there is a loop $\ell$ in $P$ which pass only through regular points and has the holonomy $\gamma$.

Fix $\gamma\in\Gamma$. 
Let $\ell$ be the corresponding loop.
Since $P$ is simply connected, we can shrink $\ell$ by a disc.
By general position argument we can assume that the disc 
only pass through simplices of codimension $0$, $1$ and $2$
and intersect the simplices of codimension $2$ transversely.

In other words, $\ell$ can be presented as a product of 
loops such that each loop goes around a single simplex of codimension $2$ and comes back.
The holonomy for each of these loops is a rotation around a hyperplane.
Hence the result follows.

his proof based ealier results of Mikhailova, see \cite{mikhailova}.

Note that the cone over spherical suspension over Poincar\'e sphere is homeomorphic to $\RR^5$ and it is quotient of $\RR^5$ by a finite subgroup of $\SO(5)$. 
I.e., if in this problem one exchanges ``PL-homeomorphism'' to ``homeomorphism'' then the answer is different; 
a complete classification of such actions was also obtained in \cite{lange}.

Let $G$ be a finitely generated subgroup of free group with $m$ generators, further denoted by $F_m$.

Let $W$ be the wedge sum of $n$ circles, 
so  $\pi_1(W,p)=F_m$.
Equip $W$ with length metric so that 
that each circle has unit length.

Pass to the metric cover $\tilde W$ of $W$ 
such that  $\pi_1(\tilde W,\tilde p)=G$ 
for a lift $\tilde p$ of $p$.

Fix sufficiently large integer $n$ and consider doubling of the closed ball $\bar B_{n+\frac12}(\tilde p)$ in its boundary.
Let us denote the obtained doubling by $Z_n$ and set $G_n=\pi(Z_n,\tilde p)$.

Prove that $Z_n$ is a metric covering of $W$;
it makes possible to consider $G_n$ as a subgroup of $F_m$.
By construction, $Z_n$ is compact;
therefore $G_n$ has finite order in $F_m$.


It remains to show that that 
\[G=\bigcap_{n>k} G_n,\]

Fix a point $p\in M$;

Given $a\in \Gamma$ denote by $\gamma_a$ a length minimizing geodesic loop in the clas $a$.
Set $|a|=\length \gamma_a$.

Let us construct so called \emph{short basis} of $a_1,a_2,\dots\in \Gamma$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose $a_1\in\Gamma$ so that $|a_1|$ takes the minimal value.
\item Choose $a_2\in\Gamma\backslash\langle a_1 \rangle$ so that $|a_2|$ takes the minimal value.
\item Choose $a_2\in\Gamma\backslash\langle a_1,a_2 \rangle$ so that $|a_2|$ takes the minimal value.
\item and so on
\end{enumerate}
Note that the sequence terminates after $n$ steps if and only if $a_1,\dots,a_n$ forms a generating set of $\Gamma$.

Given $a\in\Gamma$, set  $w_{a}=\gamma'_a(0)\in\T_p$.
Assume  
\[\measuredangle (w_{a_i}, w_{a_j})< \tfrac\pi3\] for some $i<j$.
By Toponogov comparison theorem we get $|a_ja_i^{-1}|<|a_j|$;
the later leads to a contradiction.

It follows that $\measuredangle (w_{a_i}, w_{a_j})\ge \tfrac\pi3$ for all $i\ne j$
It gives a bound on $n$ in terms of $\dim M$.

Consider the universal covering 
$\tilde\Sigma\to\Sigma$.
The surface $\tilde \Sigma$ comes with the orientation induced from $\Sigma$.

Note that we may assume that $\tilde\Sigma$ has infinite number of boundary components.

Fix a point $x_0$ on the boundary of $\tilde \Sigma$.
Given other points $y$ and $z$ we will write
$y\prec z$ if $z$ lies on the left side from one (and therefore any) simple curve in $\tilde\Sigma$ which goes from $x$ to $y$.
Note that  $\prec$ defines a linear order on $\partial\tilde\Sigma\backslash\{x\}$.
We will write $y\preceq z$ 
if $y\prec z$ or $y=z$.

Note that any homeomorphism $h\:\Sigma\to\Sigma$ which is identity on the boundary
lifts to unique homeomorphism $\tilde h\:\tilde \Sigma\to\tilde\Sigma$ 
is such a way that $\tilde h(x)=x$.

Prove that if $h$ is positive Dehn twist then 
$y\preceq \tilde h(y)$ for any $y\ne x$ in $\partial\tilde\Sigma\backslash\{x\}$
and there is a point $y_0$
such that $y_0\prec \tilde h(y_0)$.

Finally note that the later property is a homotopy invariant

Let us cut the polygon $A$ from the sphere and glue instead the polygon $B$.
Denote by $\Sigma$ the obtained spherical polyhedral space.
Note that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Sigma$ is homeomorphic $\mathbb S^2$.
\item $\Sigma$ has curvature $\ge 1$ in the sense of Alexandrov; i.e., the total angle around each singular point is less than $2\cdot \pi$.
\item All the singular points of $\Sigma$ 
lie outside of an isometric copy of a hemisphere $\mathbb{S}^2_+\subset \Sigma$
\end{itemize}

It is sufficient to show that $\Sigma$ is isometric to the standard sphere.
Assume contrary.
If $n$ denotes be the number of singular points in $\Sigma$, 
it means that $n>0$.

We will arrive to a contradiction applying induction on $n$.
The base case $n=1$ is trivial; 
i.e., $\Sigma$ can not have single singular point.

Now assume $\Sigma$ has $n>1$ singular points.
Choose two singular points $p, q$,
cut $\Sigma$ along a geodesic $[pq]$
and patch the hole so that the obtained new polyhedron $\Sigma'$ has curvature $\ge 1$.
The patch is obtained by doubling a
spherical triangle in two sides.
For the right choice of the triangle,
the points $p$ and $q$ become regular in $\Sigma'$
and exactly one new singular point appears in the patch.

This way, constructed a  spherical polyhedral space $\Sigma'$
with $n-1$ singular points which satisfy the same conditions as $\Sigma$ 

By induction hypothesis $\Sigma'$ does not exist. Hence the result follow.

\parit{Alternative end of proof.} 
By Alexandrov embedding theorem, $\Sigma$ is isometric to the surface of convex polyhedron $P$ in the unit 3-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^3$. 
The center of hemisphere has to lie in a facet, say $F$ of $P$.
It remains to note that $F$ contains the equator and therefore $P$ has to be hemisphere in $\mathbb S^3$ or intersection of two hemispheres.
In both cases its surface is isometric to $\mathbb S^2$.

For each $i$, consider function $f_i(x)=|z_i-x|^2-\eps_i^2$.
Note that
\[W_{i,j}=\set{x\in\RR^n}{f_i(x)=f_j(x)}\]
is a hyperplane for any pair $i\ne j$.

The subset $P_{i,j}=P\cap W_{i,j}$ satisfies the same asumtions as $P$, but lies in a hyperplane.
Since $m$ is minimal, we get that $P_{i,j}$ is a polytope for any pair $i,j$.

Consider Voronoi domains 
\[V_{i}=\set{x\in\RR^n}{f_i(x)\ge f_j(x) \ \text{for any}\ j}.\]
Note that $P\cap V_i$ is formed by the points which lie on the segments from $z_i$ to a point in  $P\cap \partial V_i$.

Consider the triangle $\Delta$ with angles $\tfrac\pi p$, $\tfrac\pi q$ and say $\pi\cdot(1-\tfrac1 p)$ in the sphere of radius $\tfrac12$.
Denote by $\hat \Delta$ the  doubling of $\Delta$ in its boundary.
Note that $\hat \Delta$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb S^2$,
it has 3 singular points with total angles $2\cdot\tfrac\pi p$,
$2\cdot\tfrac\pi q$ and $2\cdot\pi\cdot(1-\tfrac1 p)$.

Consider $\mathbb S^1$-action on $\mathbb S^3\subset\CC^2$ by the diagonal matrices $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}z^p&0\\0&z^q\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, $z\in\mathbb S^1\subset\CC$.
Construct a spherical polyhedral metric $d$ on  $\mathbb S^3$
such that the $\mathbb S^1$-orbits become geodesics 
and the quotient $(\mathbb S^3,d)/\mathbb S^1$
is isometric to $\hat \Delta$.

In the constructed example 
the singular points with total angles $2\cdot\tfrac\pi p$ and
$2\cdot\tfrac\pi q$
should correspond to the points with isotropy groups $\ZZ/p$ and $\ZZ/q$ of the action.
The points in $P=(\mathbb{S}^3,d)$ on the orbits over these points will be regular points of $P$.
The singular locus $P^\star$
of $P$ will be formed by the orbit corresponding to the remaining singular point of  $\hat \Delta$.
By construction,
\begin{itemize}
\item $P^\star$ is a closed geodesic with angle $2\cdot\pi\cdot(1-\tfrac1p)$ around it.
\item $P^\star$ forms a $(p,q)$-torus knot in the ambient $\mathbb{S}^3$.

Likely only the torus knots can appear this way.

The construction appears in the paper \cite{panov-Kaeler} by Panov.
The cone $K$ over $P$ is a polyhedral space with natural complex structure;
i.e., one can cut simplices from $\CC^2$ and the glue the cone from them in such a way that complex structures will agree along the gluings.
Moreover the cone $K$ can be holomorphically parametrized by $\CC^2$ in such a way that the cone over $P^\star$ becomes an algebraic curve $z^p=w^q$ in $(z,w)$-coordinates of $\CC^2$.

Consider a closed geodesic $\gamma_1$ which minimize the length of all circles which are not null-homotopic.
Let $\gamma_2$ be an other closed geodesic which minimize the length and is not homotopic to any power of $\gamma_1$.

Show that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ intersect at a single point.

Show that $\gamma_i$ can not pass $v_5$.

Apply the observation above 
to show that if $\gamma_i$ pass through $v_7$ then the measure  
of one of two angles which $\gamma_i$ cuts at $v_7$ equals to $\pi$.
Use the later statement to show that  
one can push $\gamma_i$ aside so it does not longer pass through $v_7$, but remains a closed geodesic.

Cut $\TT^2$ along $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.
In the obtained quadrilateral, connect $v_5$ to $v_7$ by a minimizing geodesic and cut along it.
This way we obtain an annulus with flat metric.
Look at the neighborhood of the boundary components and show that the anulus can and can not be isometrically immersed into the plane;
this is a contradiction.

There are flat metrics on the torus with two singular points which have the total angles $\tfrac53\cdot\pi$ and $\tfrac73\cdot\pi$.
Such example can be obtained by identifying the the hexagon on the picture  according to the arrows.
But the holonomy group of the obtained torus is generated by the rotation by angle $\tfrac\pi6$. 
In particular, the observation is necessary in the proof.

The same argument shows that 
holonomy group of flat torus with exactly two singular points with total angle $2\cdot(1\pm \tfrac1n)\cdot\pi$ has more than $n$ elements.
In the solution we did the case $n=6$.

The problem was originally discovered and solved in \cite{jendrol-jucovich},

Show that there are two distinct minimizing geodesics between $x$ and $y$.
The later leads to a contradiction.

The existence of geodesic $\gamma$ seem to be proved first by Bowditch in \cite{bowditch};
a simpler proof can be found in \cite{akp}.

\parbf{\ref{No simple geodesic}.} 
\textit{No simple geodesic.}
The curvature of a vertex on the surface of a convex polyhedron
is defined as the $2\cdot\pi-\theta$, where $\theta$ is the total angle around the vertex.

Notice that a simple closed geodesic cuts the surface into two discs with total curvature $2\cdot\pi$ each.
Therefore it is sufficient to construct a convex polyhedron with curvatures of the vertices $\omega_1,\omega_2,\dots,\omega_n$ such that
$2\cdot\pi$ can not be obtained as sum of some of $\omega_i$.
An example of that type can be found among 3-simplexes.

\textit{Box in a box.}
Let $\Pi$ be a parallelepiped
with dimensions $a$, $b$ and $c$.
Denote by $v(r)$ the volume of  $r$-neighborhoodsof $\Pi$,
 
Note that for all positive $r$ we have
\[v(r)=w_3+w_2\cdot r+w_1\cdot r^2+w_0\cdot r^3,\leqno({*})\]
where 
\begin{itemize}
\item $w_0=\tfrac43\cdot \pi$ is the volume of unit ball,
\item $w_1=\pi\cdot (a+b+c)$,
\item $w_2=2\cdot(a\cdot b+b\cdot c+c\cdot a)$ is the surface area of $\Pi$,
\item $w_3=a\cdot b\cdot c$ is the volume of $\Pi$,
\end{itemize}

Assume $\Pi'$ be an other parallelepiped
with dimensions $a'$, $b'$ and $c'$.
For the volume $v'(r)$ the volume of  $r$-neighborhoods of $\Pi'$ we have a formula similar $({*})$.

Note that if $\Pi\subset \Pi'$ then $v(r)\le v'(r)$ for any $r$.
Checking this inequality for $r\to\infty$,
we get 
\[a+b+c\le a'+b'+c'.\]

\parit{Comments.}
The problem was discussed by Shen in \cite{shen}.

A formula analogous to $({*})$
holds for arbitrary convex body $B$ in arbitrary dimension $n$.
The coefficient $w_i(B)$ in the polynomial with different normalization constants 
uppear under different names most commonly
\emph{intrinsic volume} and
\emph{quermassintegral}.
The later can be also defined as the average 
of area of projections of $B$ to the $i$-dimensional planes.
In particular if $B'$ and $B$ are convex bodies such that $B'\subset B$
then $w_i(B')\le w_i(B)$ for any $i$.
This generalize our problem quite a bit.
Further generalizations lead to so called \emph{mixed volumes},
see \cite{burago-zalgaller} for more on the subject.

\textit{Round circles in $\mathbb{S}^3$.}
For each circle consider the containing it plane in $\RR^4$.
Note that the circles are linked 
if and only if 
the corresponding planes intersect at a single point inside $\mathbb{S}^3$.

Take the intersection of the planes with the sphere of radius $R\ge 1$,
rescale and pass to the limit as $R\to\infty$.  
This way we get needed isotopy.

Let $\sigma\subset \RP^2$ be a smooth algebraic curve of degree $d$.
Consider the complexification $\Sigma\subset \CP^2$ of $\sigma$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\Sigma$ is regular.

Prove that all regular complex algebraic curves of degree $d$ in $\RP^2$
are homeomorphic to each other.
Straightforward calculation show that $\Sigma$ has genus $n\z=\tfrac12\cdot(d^2-3\cdot d+4)$.

The real curve $\sigma$ forms the fixed point set of $\Sigma$ by complex conjugation. 
Prove that each connected component of $\sigma$ adds $1$ to the genus of $\Sigma$.
Hence the result follows.

\parbf{\ref{2pts-on-line}.} 
\textit{Two points on each line.}
Take any complete ordering of the set of all lines 
so that each beginning interval has cardinality less than continuum.

Assume we have a set of points $X$ such that each line intersects $X$ at at most $2$ points and cardinality of $X$ is less than continuum.

Choose the least line $\ell$ in the ordering which intersect $X$ 
by $0$ or $1$ point.
Note that the set of all lines intersecting $X$ at two points has cardinality less than continuum.
Therefore we can choose a point on $\ell$ and add it to $X$ so that the remaining lines are not overloaded.

It remains to apply well ordering principle.

\textit{Kissing number.}
Let $m=\mathop{\rm kiss} B$
and $B_1,B_2,\dots, B_m$ the the copies of $B$ 
which touch $B$ and have no common interior points.
For each $B_i$ consider the vector $v_i$ from the center of $B$ to the center of $B_i$.
Note that $\measuredangle(v_i,v_j)\ge \tfrac\pi3$ if $i\ne j$.

For each $i$,
consider supporting hyperplane $\Pi_i$
to $W$
with outer normal vector $v_i$.
Denote by $W_i$ the reflection of $W$ in $\Pi_i$.

Prove that $W_i$ and $W_j$ have no common interior points if $i\ne j$;
the later gives the needed inequality.

The proof is given by Halberg, Levin and Straus in \cite{halberg-levin-straus}.

It expected that the same inequality holds for the orientation-preserving version of kissing number.

\textit{Monotonic homotopy.}
Note that we can assume
that $h_0(F)$ and $h_1(F)$ both lie in the coordinate $n$-spaces of $\RR^{2\cdot n}=\RR^n\times \RR^n$;
i.e.,
$h_0(F)\z\subset\RR^n\times\{0\}$
and $h_1(F)\subset  \{0\}\times\RR^n$.

Show that the following homotopy is monotonic
\[h_t(x)=\bigl(h_0(x)\cdot \cos\tfrac{\pi\cdot t}2
\,,\,
 h_1(x)\cdot\sin\tfrac{\pi\cdot t}{2}\bigr).\]

This homotopy was discovered by Ralph Alexander in \cite{ralexander}.

\parbf{\ref{Cube}.} 
\textit{Cube.}
Consider the cube $[-1,1]^n\subset \RR^n$.
Any vertex this cube has the form $\bm{q}=(q_1,q_2,\dots,q_n)$,
where  $q_i=\pm1$.

For each vertex $\bm{q}$,
consider the intersection of the corresponding octant with the unit sphere;
i.e., the set
\[V_{\bm{q}}=\set{(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}{q_i\cdot x_i\ge 0\ \text{for each}\ i}.\]

Consider the set $\mathcal{A}\subset\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$
formed by the union of all the sets $V_{\bm{q}}$ for $\bm{q}\in A$.
Note that 
\[\vol_{n-1}\mathcal{A}=\tfrac12\cdot\vol_{n-1}\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\]
and 
\[\vol_{n-2}\partial\mathcal{A}
=
\tfrac k{2^{n-1}}\cdot\vol_{n-2}\mathbb{S}^{n-2},\]
where $k$ is the number of edges of the cube with one end in $A$ and the other in $B$.

It remains to  show that 
\[\vol_{n-2}\partial\mathcal{A}
\ge \vol_{n-2}\mathbb{S}^{n-2}.\]
The later follows from the isoperimetric inequality for $\mathbb{S}^n$.

\parbf{\ref{Right-angled polyhedron}.} 
\textit{Right-angled polyhedron.}
Before coming into proof read 
about \hyperref[Dehn--Sommerville equations]{\emph{Dehn--Sommerville equations}}
on page \pageref{Dehn--Sommerville equations}.

Let $P$ be a right-angled hyperbolic polyhedron of dimension $m$.
Note that $P$ is simple; i.e., exactly $m$ facets meet at each vertex of $P$.

From the projective model of hyperbolic plane, 
one can see that for any simple compact hyperbolic polyhedron there is a simple Euclidean polyhedron with the same combinatorics. 
In particular Dehn--Sommerville equations hold for $P$.

Denote by $(f_0,f_1,\dots f_m)$ and $(h_0,h_1,\dots h_m)$ the $f$- and $h$-vectors of $P$.
Recall that $h_i\ge 0$ for any $i$ and $h_0=h_m=1$.
By Dehn--Sommerville equations, we get
\[f_2> \tfrac{m-2}4\cdot f_1.
\leqno({*})\]

Since $P$ is hyperbolic, each 2-dimensional face of $P$ has at least 5 sides.
It follows that
\[f_2\le \tfrac{m-1}5\cdot f_1.\]
The later contradicts $({*})$ for $m\ge 6$.

\parit{Comments.} 
The proof above is the core of Vinberg's proof of nonexistance of compact hyperbolic Coxeter's polyhedra of large dimensions.

Playing a bit more with the same inequalities, 
one gets nonexistance of  right-angled hyperbolic polyhedra,
in all dimensions starting from $5$.
In 4-dimensional case, an example of a bonded right-angled hyperbolic polyhedron
can be found among regular \emph{120-cells}.
