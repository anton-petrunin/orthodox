and $\Pi$ be a plane that cuts from $\Sigma$ a disc $\Delta$.
Assume that the reflection of $\Delta$ in $\Pi$ lies inside of $\Sigma$.
Show that $\Delta$ is \index{convex set}\emph{convex} in the intrinsic metric  of $\Sigma$;
that is, 
if the ends of a minimizing geodesic in $\Sigma$ 
lie in $\Delta$,
then whole geodesic lies in $\Delta$.

\parit{Semisolution.}
Let $\gamma$ be a minimizing geodesic with the ends in $\Delta$.

Assume $\gamma\backslash\Delta\ne\emptyset$.
Denote by $\hat\gamma$ the curve formed by $\gamma\cap \Delta$ 
and the reflection on $\gamma\backslash\Delta$ in $\Pi$.
Note that
\[\length\hat\gamma=\length\gamma\]
and $\hat\gamma$ runs partly along $\Sigma$ 
and partly outside of $\Sigma$, 
but does not get inside of $\Sigma$.

Denote by $\bar\gamma$ the closest point projection of $\hat\gamma$ on $\Sigma$.
Since $\Sigma$ is convex, the closest point projection shrinks the length.
Therefore 
the curve $\bar\gamma$ lies in $\Sigma$, 
it has the same ends as $\gamma$
and
\[\length\bar\gamma<\length\gamma.\]
It means that $\gamma$ is not length minimizing, 
a contradiction.\qeds

\label{Simple geodesic}

\begin{pr}
Let $\Sigma$ be a complete unbounded convex surface in $\mathbb R^3$.

Let us review couple of statements 
about Gauss curvature which might help to solve the problem \cite[see \S28 in][for more details]{hilbert-cohn-vossen}.

If $\Sigma$ is a convex surface in $\RR^3$ then its Gauss curvature is nonnegative.

Assume that a simply connected region $\Omega$ in the surface $\Sigma$ is bounded by a closed broken geodesic $\gamma$.
Denote by $\kappa(\Omega)$ the integral of Gauss curvaure along $\Omega$.

For any point $p\in\Sigma$ consider outer unit normal vector $n(p)\in\mathbb{S}^2$.
Then 
\begin{align*}
\kappa(\Omega)&=\area[n(\Omega)]
\intertext{and by Gauss--Bonnet formula}
\kappa(\Omega)&=2\cdot\pi-\sigma(\gamma),
\end{align*}
where $\sigma(\gamma)$ denotes the sum of the signed exterior angles of $\gamma$.
In particular,  $|\sigma(\gamma)|\le2\cdot\pi$.

\subsection*{Geodesics for birds}
\label{liberman}

The \index{total curvature}\emph{total curvature} of a space curve $\gamma$ is defined as the integral of its curvature.
That is, if a curve $\gamma\:[a,b]\to\RR^3$ has unit speed parametrization, 
then the total curvature of $\gamma$ equals to 
\[\int\limits_a^b|\gamma''(t)|\cdot dt,\]
the vector $\gamma''(t)$ is called \index{curvature vector}\emph{curvature vector} and its magnitude $|\gamma''(t)|$ is the \index{curvature}\emph{curvature} of $\gamma$ at time $t$.
The above definition has sense for $C^{1,1}$ smooth curves,
that is, if $\gamma'(t)$ is locally Lipschitz;
in this case the curvature $|\gamma''(t)|$ defined almost everywhere.

The \index{geodesic}\emph{geodesics} in the following problem are defined as the curves locally minimizing the length;
that is, a sufficiently short arc of the curve containing the given value of parameter is length minimizing.

\begin{pr}
Let $f\:\RR^2\to\RR$ be a smooth $\ell$-Lipschitz function.
Let $W\subset \RR^3$ be the epigraph of $f$;
that is,
$$W=\set{(x,y,z)\in\RR^3}{z\ge f(x,y)}.$$
Equip $W$ with the induced intrinsic metric.

Show that any geodesic in $W$ 
 has  total curvature at most $2\cdot\ell$. 
\end{pr}

Actually, geodesics in $W$ are $C^{1,1}$-smooth;
in particular, the formula for total curvature mentioned above makes sense.
This is an easy exercise in real analysis which can be also taken as granted.

Let $W$ be the closed unbounded set formed by $\Sigma$ and its exterior points.
Fix $t\in (0,\ell)$;
denote by $\gamma_t$ the concatenation of the line segment $[p_t\gamma(t)]$ and the arc $\gamma|_{[t,\ell]}$.
The key step is to show the following:

{

\begin{cl}{$({*})$} The curve $\gamma_t$ is a minimizing geodesic in the intrinsic metric induced on $W$.

\end{wrapfigure}

Try to prove it before reading further.

\medskip

Let $\Pi_t$ be the tangent plane to $\Sigma$ at $\gamma(t)$.
Consider the curve $\alpha(t)=p_t$.
Note that  
$\alpha(t)\z\in\Pi_t$,
$\alpha'(t)\perp\Pi_t$
and $\alpha'(t)$ points to the side of $\Pi_t$ opposite from $\Sigma$.



It follows that for any $x\in\Sigma$ the function  
\[t\mapsto |x - p_t|
\quad\text{and, therefore,}\quad
t\mapsto |x - p_t|_W\] are non-decreasing;
here $|x - p_t|_W$ stays for the intrinsic distance from $x$ to $p_t$ in $W$.

}

On the other hand, by construction 
\[|q - p_t|_W\le |q - p|_\Sigma;\] 
therefore, from above 
\[|q - p_t|_W= |q - p|_\Sigma\]
for any $t$.
Hence $(*)$ follows.

Now assume $q$ is visible from $p_t$ for some $t$;
that is, the line segment $[qp_t]$ intersects $\Sigma$ only at $q$.
From above, 
$\gamma_t$  coincides with the line segment $[qp_t]$.
On the other hand $\gamma_t$ contains $\gamma(t)\in\Sigma$, a contradiction.\qeds

This problem is based on an observation used by Anatoliy Milka in the proof of his (beautiful) generalization of comparison theorem for convex surfaces \cite[see][]{milka-geod}.

\parbf{Simple geodesic.} 
Look at two combinatoric types of self-intersections shown on the diagram.
One of the types can and the other can not appear as self-intersections of geodesic on an unbounded convex surface.
Try to determine which is which before reading further.

\medskip

Let $\gamma$ be a two-sided infinite geodesic in $\Sigma$.
The following is the key statement in the proof.

\begin{cl}{$({*})$}
The geodesic $\gamma$ contains at most one simple loop.
\end{cl}

To prove $({*})$, we use the following observation.

\begin{cl}{$({*}{*})$}
The integral curvature $\omega$ of $\Sigma$ cannot exceed $2\cdot\pi$.
\end{cl}

Indeed, since $\Sigma$ is unbounded and convex,
it surrounds a half-line.
Consider a coordinate system with this half-line as the positive half of $z$-axis. 
In these coordinates, the surface $\Sigma$ is described as a graph $z=f(x,y)$ for a convex function $f$.
In particular the outer normal vectors to $\Sigma$ point in the south hemisphere.
Therefore the area of spherical image of $\Sigma$ is at most $2\cdot\pi$.
The area of this image is the integral of Gauss curvature along $\Sigma$. 
Hence $({*}{*})$ follows.

From Gauss--Bonnet formula, we get the following.
If $\phi$ is the angle at the base of a simple geodesic loop then the integral curvature surrounded by the loop equals to $\pi+\phi$. 
In particular there are no concave loops.

Now assume $({*})$ does not hold, so a geodesic has two simple loops.
Note that the discs bounded by loops  have to overlap,
otherwise the curvature of $\Sigma$ will axceed $2\cdot\pi$.
But if they overlap, then it is easy to show that the curve also contains a concave loop, 
which contradicts the observation above.%
\footnote{This observation implies that the right picture on the diagram above can not be realized by a geodesic.}

If a geodesic $\gamma$ has a self-intersection,
then it contains a simple loop.
From $({*})$, there is only one such loop;
it cuts a disc from $\Sigma$ 
and can go around it either clockwise or counterclockwise.
This way we divide all the self-intersecting geodesics 
into two sets which we will call {}\emph{clockwise} and {}\emph{counterclockwise}.

Note that the geodesic $t\mapsto \gamma(t)$ is clockwise 
if and only if 
$t\mapsto \gamma(-t)$
is counterclockwise.
The sets of clockwise and counterclockwise are open and the space of geodesics is connected. 
It follows that there are geodesics 
which are, neither clockwise, nor counterclockwise.
These geodesics have no self-intersections.\qeds


The problem is due to Stephan Cohn-Vossen, \cite[see Satz 9 in][]{convossen};
generalizations were obtained  by 
Vladimir Streltsov and Alexandr Alexandrov 
\cite[see][]{streltsov-alexandrov} 
and 
by Victor Bangert \cite[see][]{bangert}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Geodesics for birds.}
Fix a unit-speed geodesic in $W$, say
\[\gamma\:t\mapsto(x(t),y(t),z(t)).\]
We can assume that $\gamma$ is defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$.
The key step is to show the following:

\begin{cl}{$({*})$} 
The function $t\mapsto z$ is concave.
\end{cl}


Parametrize the plane curve $t\mapsto (x(t),y(t))$ by arclength $s$
and reparametrize $\gamma$ by $s$.

Note that the function $s\mapsto z$ is concave.
If not, one could shorten $\gamma$ by moving its points up, in the direction of $z$-axis, and keeping its ends fixed.
Moreover, this deformation can be performed in an arbitrary small neighborhood of some point on $\gamma$.
After the deformation, the curve still lies in $W$.
The latter contradicts that $\gamma$ locally length minimizing.

\begin{center}
 \begin{lpic}[t(-2 mm),b(-0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/liberman(1)}
\lbl[t]{25,8;$s$}

\lbl[bl]{55.5,3.5;$x$}
\lbl[rb]{53,16;$y$}
\lbl[br]{62,22;$\gamma$}
\end{lpic}
\end{center}

Finally note that concavity of $s\mapsto z$ is equivalent to the concavity of $t\mapsto z$.
Hence $({*})$ follows.

Since $f$ is smooth, 
the curve $\gamma(t)$ is $C^{1,1}$; 
that is, its first derivative $\gamma'(t)$ is a well defined Lipschitz function.
It follows that second derivative $\gamma''(t)$ is defined almost everywhere.

Since $z(t)$ is concave, we have $z''(t)\le 0$.
Since $f$ is $\ell$-Lipschitz, $z(t)$ is $\tfrac{\ell}{\sqrt{1+\ell^2}}$-Lipschitz.
It follows that 
\[\int\limits_a^b |z''(t)|\le 2\cdot\tfrac{\ell}{\sqrt{1+\ell^2}}.\]

The curvature vector $\gamma''(t)$ is perpendicular to the surface.
Since the surface has slope at most $\ell$,
we get 
\[|\gamma''(t)|\le |z''(t)|\cdot\sqrt{1+\ell^2}.\]
Hence 
\[\int\limits_a^b |\gamma''(t)|\le 2\cdot\ell.\qedsin\]
\medskip

The statement holds for general $\ell$-Lischitz function,
not necessary smooth.
The given bound is optimal, the equality is reached for both side infinite geodesic on the graph of  
\[f(x,y)=-\ell\cdot\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.\]

The problem is due to David Berg \cite[see][]{berg}
the same bound for convex $\ell$-Lipschitz surfaces was proved earlier by Vladimir Usov \cite[see][]{usov}.
The observation $({*})$
is called \index{Liberman’s lemma}\emph{Liberman’s lemma}; 
it was used yet earlier 
to bound the total curvature
of a geodesic on a convex surface \cite[see][]{liberman}.\footnote{It was a part of the thesis of Joseph Liberman, defended couple of months before his death in the WWII.}
This lemma is often useful when geodesics on convex surfaces are considered.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Immersed surface.}
Let $\ell$ be a linear function that vanishes on $\Pi$ 
and is positive on $\Sigma$. 
We will apply Morse type argument for the restriction of $\ell$ to $\Sigma$.

\medskip

Let $z_0$ be a point of maximum of $\ell$ on $\Sigma$;
set $s_0=\ell(z_0)$.
Given $s<s_0$, denote by $\Sigma_s$ the connected component of $z_0$ in $\Sigma\cap\ell^{-1}([s,s_0])$.
Note that for all $s$ sufficiently close to $s_0$
we have
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Sigma_s$ is an embedded disc;
\item $\partial\Sigma_s$ is convex plane curve.
\end{itemize}

Applying open-closed argument, we get that the same holds for all $s\in[0,s_0)$.

Since $\Sigma$ is connected, $\Sigma_0=\Sigma$.
Hence the result follows.\qeds


This problem is discussed in the lectures of Mikhael Gromov \cite[see \S$\tfrac12$~in][]{gromov-SGMC}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Periodic asymptote.}
Arguing by contradiction, assume that there is a geodesic $\gamma$ on the surface $\Sigma$ with a periodic asymptote $\delta$. 

Passing to a finite cover of $\Sigma$, we can ensure that the asymptote has no self-intersections.
In this case 
the restriction $\gamma|_{[a,\infty)}$  
has no self-intersections, 
if $a$ is large enuf.

Cut $\Sigma$ along $\gamma([a,\infty))$ and then cut from the obtained surface an infinite triangle $\triangle$. 
The triangle $\triangle$ has two sides formed by both sides of cuts along $\gamma$;
let us denote these sides of $\triangle$ by $\gamma_-$ and $\gamma_+$.
Note that 
\[\area\triangle<\area \Sigma<\infty\leqno(*)\]
and both sides $\gamma_\pm$ 
are infinite minimizing geodesics in $\triangle$.

Consider the Busemann function $f$ for $\gamma_+$ [defined on page~\pageref{page:Busemann function}];
denote by $\ell(t)$ the length of the level curve $f^{-1}(t)$.
Let $-\kappa(t)$  be the total curvature of the sup-level set $f^{-1}([t,\infty))$.  
From Gauss--Bonnet formula,
\[\ell'(t)=\kappa(t).\leqno({*}{*})\]

The level curve $f^{-1}(t)$ can be parametrized by a unit-speed curve, say $\theta_t\:[0,\ell(t)]\to \triangle$.
By coarea formula we have
\[\kappa'(t)
=
-\int\limits_0^{\ell(t)} K_{\theta_t(\tau)}\cdot d\tau,
\]
where $K_x$ denotes the Gauss curvature of $\Sigma$ at the point $x$.
Since $K_{\theta_t(0)}=K_{\theta_t(\ell_t)}=0$ and the surface is smooth,
there is a constant $C$ such that $|K_{\theta_t(\tau)}|\le C\cdot \ell(t)^2$ for all $t$, $\tau$.
Therefore
\[\kappa'(t)\le C\cdot \ell(t)^3 \leqno(\asterism)\]

Together, $({*}{*})$ and $(\asterism)$ imply that there is $\eps>0$ such that
\[\ell(t)\ge \frac\eps{t-a}\]
for any large $t$.
By the coarea formula we get 
\[\area\triangle=\int\limits_a^\infty\ell(t)=\infty;\]
the latter contradicts $(*)$.\qeds

I have learned the problem from 
Dmitri Burago 
and Sergei Ivanov, 
it is originated from a discussion with
Keith Burns, 
Michael Brin 
and Yakov Pesin.

Here is a motivation:
assume $\Sigma$ is a closed surface with non-positive curvature that is not flat.
The space $\Gamma$ of all unit-speed geodesics $\gamma\:\RR\to\Sigma$ can be identified with the unit tangent bundle $\UU\Sigma$. 
In particular $\Gamma$ comes with a natural choice of measure.
Denote by $\Gamma_0\subset \Gamma$ the set of geodesics that run in the set of zero curvature all the time.
It is expected that $\Gamma_0$ has vanishing measure.
In all known examples $\Gamma_0$ contains only periodic geodesics in only finitely many homotopy classes \cite[see also][]{hertz}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Saddle surface.}
Denote by $\Sigma^\circ$ the interior of $\Sigma$.
Fix a plane $\Pi$. 
Note that the intersection $\Pi\cap \Sigma^\circ$ 
locally  looks like a curve or two curves intersecting transversally;
in the latter case $\Pi$ is tangent to $\Sigma^\circ$ at the cross-point.

Further note that $\Pi\cap \Sigma^\circ$ has no cycle.
Otherwise $\Sigma$ would fail to be saddle at the point of the disc surrounded by the cycle that maximize the distance to $\Pi$.

If $\Sigma$ is not a graph then there is a point $p\in\Sigma$ with vertical tangent plane;
denote this plane by $\Pi$.
The intersection $\Pi\cap\Sigma$ has cross-point at~$p$.

Since the boundary of $\Sigma$ projects injectively to a closed convex curve in $(x,y)$-plane,
the intersection of $\Pi\cap\partial \Sigma$ has at most 2 points --- these are the only endpoints of $\Pi\cap\Sigma$.

It follows that the connected component of $p$ in $\Pi\cap\Sigma$ is a tree 
with a vertex of degree 4 at $p$ and at most two end-points, a contradiction.\qeds

The described idea can be used to prove the result Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung  Yau \cite[see][]{schoen-yau-2D} which gives a sufficient condition for harmonic map between surfaces to be diffeomorphism.
Unlike the original proof, it requires no calculations.

The proof above is based on the observation 
that for any saddle surface $\Sigma$ and plane $\Pi$,
each connected component of $\Sigma\backslash \Pi$ is unbounded or contains points on the boundary curve.
This observation plays a central role in the proof of Sergei Bernstein \cite[see][]{bernshtein}
of the following problem:

\begin{pr}
Show that a smooth bounded function $f\:\RR^2\to\RR$ can not have strictly saddle graph.
\end{pr}

One can go further and define \emph{generalized saddle surface} as arbitrary (non necessarily smooth) surface that satisfies the observation above.
The geometry of these surfaces is far from being understood,
Samuil Shefel has number of beautiful results about them, 
\cite[see][and the references there in]{shefel, AKP-invitation}.
The problem holds for these generalized saddle surfaces, but
the proof tricky \cite[see][]{petrunin-stadler}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Asymptotic line.}
Arguing by contradiction, assume that the projection $\bar\gamma$
of $\gamma$ on $(x, y)$-plane is star shaped with respect to the origin.

Consider the function 
$$h(t)=(d_{\bar\gamma(t)}f)(\bar\gamma(t));$$
here $\bar\gamma(t)$ is considered as a vector in the $(x, y)$-plane where the differential  $d_{\bar\gamma(t)}f$ is defined.

Direct calculations show $h'(t)\ne 0$.
In particular $h(t)$ is a strictly monotonic function of $\mathbb{S}^1$, a contradiction.\qeds

The problem is discussed by Dmitri Panov \cite[see][]{panov-curves}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Minimal surface.}
Without loss of generality we may assume that the sphere is centered at the origin of $\RR^3$.

Let $h$ be the restriction of the function $x\mapsto \tfrac12\cdot|x|^2$ to the surface $\Sigma$.
Direct calculations show that $\Delta_\Sigma h\le 2$.
Applying the divergence theorem for $\nabla_\Sigma h$
in $\Sigma_r=\Sigma\cap B(0,r)$, we get
\[2\cdot \area\Sigma_r\le r\cdot\length [\partial\Sigma_r].\]

Set $a(r)=\area\Sigma_r$.
By coarea formula, $a'(r)\ge\length [\partial\Sigma_r]$ at almost all $r$.
Therefore the function
\[f\:r\mapsto \frac{\area\Sigma_r}{r^2}
\]
is non-decreasing in the interval $(0,1)$.

Since $f(r)\to \pi$ as $r\to0$, the result follows.\qeds

We described a partial case of the so called \index{monotonicity formula}\emph{monotonicity formula} for minimal surfaces.

The same argument shows that if $0$ is a double point
of $\Sigma$ then $\area\Sigma\ge 2\cdot \pi$.
This observation was used in the proof 
that the minimal disc bounded by a simple closed curve with total curvature $\le 4\cdot\pi$ 
is necessarily embedded.
It was proved by 
Tobias Ekholm, 
Brian White 
and Daniel Wienholtz
\cite[see][]{EWW};
an amusing simplification and generalization
was obtained by

This result also implies that any embedded circle of total curvature at most $4\cdot\pi$ is unknot.
The latter was proved inependently by Istv{\'a}n F{\'a}ry \cite[see][]{fary-knot} and  John Milnor \cite[see][]{milnor}.

Note that if we assume in addition that the surface is a disc,
then the statement holds for any saddle surface. 
Indeed, denote by $S_r$ the sphere of radius $r$ concentrated with the unit sphere. 
Then according to the problem ``A curve in a sphere'' [page \pageref{A curve in a sphere}], 
\[\length[\partial\Sigma_r]\ge 2\cdot\pi\cdot r.\]
Then by coarea formula we get $\area\Sigma\ge \pi$.

On the other hand there are saddle surfaces homeomorphic to the cylinder
that may have arbitrary small area in the ball. 

If $\Sigma$ does not pass thru the center 
and we only know the distance, say $r$, 
from the center to $\Sigma$,
then the optimal bound is $\pi\cdot(1-r^2)$.
This question was open for about 40 years and proved by Simon Brendle and Pei-Ken Hung \cite[see][]{brende-hung};
their proof is based on a similar idea and quite elementary.
Earlier Herbert Alexander, 
David Hoffman
and Robert Osserman 
proved it in two cases (1) for discs and (2) for arbitrary area minimizing surfaces, any dimension and codimension
 \cite[see][]{alexander-osserman,alexander-hoffman-osserman}.

\parbf{Round gutter.}
Without loss of generality, we can assume that the length of $\gamma$ is $2{\cdot}\pi$ and its intrinsic curvature is $1$ at all points.

Let $K$ be the convex hull of $\hat\Omega=\iota(\Omega)$.
Part of $\hat\Omega$ touch the boundary of $K$ and part lies in the interior of $K$. 
Denote by $\hat\gamma$ the curve in $\hat\Omega$ dividing these two parts.

First note that the Gauss curvature of $\hat\Omega$ has to vanish at the points of $\hat\gamma$;
in other words, $\hat\gamma=\iota(\gamma)$.
Indeed, since $\hat\gamma$ lies on convex part, 
the Gauss curvature at the points of $\hat\gamma$ has to be non-negative. 
On the other hand $\hat\gamma$ bounds a flat disc in $\partial K$;
therefore its integral intrinsic curvature has to be $2{\cdot}\pi$.
If the Gauss curvature is positive at some point of $\hat\gamma$, 
then by Gauss--Bonnet formula, the total intrinsic curvature of $\hat\gamma$ has to be smaller than $2{\cdot}\pi$, a contradiction.

On the other hand $\hat\gamma$ is an asymptotic line.
Indeed, if the direction of $\hat\gamma$ is not asymptotic at some $t_0$
then $\hat\gamma(t\pm\eps)$ lies the interior of $K$ for some small $\eps>0$, a contradiction.

Therefore, as the space curve,
$\hat\gamma$ has to be a curve with constant curvature $1$ and it should be closed.
Any such curve is congruent to a unit circle.\qeds

It is not known if $\hat\Omega$ is congruent to $\Omega$.

The solution presented above is based on my answer 
to the question of Joseph O'Rourke \cite[see][]{rourke}.
Here are some related statements.
\begin{itemize}
\item A gutter is second order rigid;
this was proved by Eduard Rembs
[see \ncite{rembs} and also page 135 in \ncite{efimov}].
\item Any second order rigid surface does not admit analytic deformation 
[proved by Nikolay Efimov, see page 121 in \ncite{efimov}]
and for the surfaces of revolution, the assumption of analyticity can be removed 
\cite[proved by Idzhad Sabitov, see][]{sabitov}.
\end{itemize}

\parbf{Non-contractible geodesics.}
A torus of revolution is an example.

\medskip

Let $T$ be a torus of revolution;
it has a family {}\emph{meridians} --- a family of circles that form closed geodesics.

Note that a geodesic on $T$ is either a meridian
or it intersects meridians transversally.
In the latter case all the meridiangs are crossed by the geodesic in the same direction.

A contactable curve has to cross each meridian equal number of times in both directions.
Hence no geodesics of the torus are contractible.\qeds 




I learned this problem 
from the book of Mikhael Gromov \cite[see][]{gromov-MetStr},
where it is attributed to Y. Colin de Verdi\`ere.
I do not know generic examples of that type.

\parbf{Two discs.}
Choose a continuous map $h\:\Sigma_1\to \Sigma_2$
that is identical on $\gamma$.
Let us prove that for some $p_1\in \Sigma_1$ and $p_2=h(p_1)\in \Sigma_2$
the tangent plane $\T_{p_1} \Sigma_1$ is parallel to the tangent plane $\T_{p_2} \Sigma_2$;
this is stronger than required.

\medskip

Arguing by contradiction,
assume that such point does not exist.
Then for each $p\in\Sigma_1$
there is unique line $\ell_p\ni p$ 
that is parallel to each of the tangent planes $\T_{p} \Sigma_1$ and $\T_{h(p)} \Sigma_2$.

Note that the lines $\ell_p$ form a tangent line distribution over $\Sigma_1$
and $\ell_p$ is tangent to $\gamma$ at any $p\in\gamma$.

Let $\Delta$ be the disc in $\Sigma_1$ bounded by $\gamma$.
Consider the doubling of $\Delta$ along  $\gamma$;
it is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb S^2$.
The line distribution $\ell$ lifts to a line distribution on the doubling.
The latter contradicts the hairy ball theorem.\qeds


This proof was suggested nearly simultaneously 
by Steven Sivek 
and Damiano Testa \cite[see][]{two-discs}.

Note that the same proof works in case $\Sigma_i$ are oriented open surfaces such that $\gamma$ cuts a compact domain in each $\Sigma_i$.

There are examples of three disks $\Sigma_1$, $\Sigma_2$ and $\Sigma_3$
with a common closed curve $\gamma$ such that there 
no triple of points $p_i\in\Sigma_i$ with parallel tangent planes.
Such examples can be found among ruled surfaces \cite[see][]{three-discs}.
