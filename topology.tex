In this chapter we consider geometrical problems with strong topological flavor.
A typical introductory course in topology, say \cite{kosniowski},
contains all the necessary material.

\subsection*{Isotropy}\label{Isotropy}

Recall that an isotopy is a continuous one parameter family of embeddings.

\begin{pr}
Let $K_1$ and $K_2$ be homeomorphic closed subsets of the coordinate subspace $\RR^m$ in $\RR^{2\cdot m}$.
Show that there is a homeomorphism 
\[h\:\RR^{2\cdot m}\z\to \RR^{2\cdot m}\] 
such that $K_2=h(K_1)$.
Moreover, $h$ can be chosen to be isotopic to the identity map.
\end{pr}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parit{Semisolution.}
Fix a homeomorphism $\phi\:K_1\to K_2$.

By Tietze extension theorem,
the homeomorphisms $\phi\:K_1\z\to K_2$ and $\phi^{-1}\:K_2\z\to K_1$ can be extended to a continuous maps;
denote these maps by $f\:\RR^m\z\to \RR^m$ and $g\:\RR^m\z\to \RR^m$ correspondingly.

Consider the homeomorphisms
$h_1, h_2, h_3\:\RR^m\times\RR^m\z\to\RR^m\times\RR^m$ defined the following way
\begin{align*}
h_1(x,y)&=(x,y+f(x)),
\\
h_2(x,y)&=(x-g(y),y),
\\ 
h_3(x,y)&=(y,-x).
\end{align*}

}

It remains to observe that each homeomorphism $h_i$ is isotopic to the identity map and
\[K_2=h_3\circ h_2\circ h_1(K_1).\qedsin\]


This construction is called \emph{Klee's trick}; it is due to Victor Klee \cite[see][]{klee}.
This trick used in the five-line proof of the Jordan separation theorem by Patrick Doyle \cite[see][]{doyle};
a proof of the separation theorem for the embeddings $\mathbb{S}^n\hookrightarrow\mathbb{S}^{n+1}$
can be build on the same idea \cite[see][]{cohen}. 

The problem ``Monotonic homotopy'' on page \pageref{mono-homotopy} looks similar.

Two immersions $f_1$ and $f_2$ of the disc $\DD$ into the plane will be called {}\emph{essentially different}

$f_1=f_2\circ h$.

Let $\Sigma$ be a surface and

be non-contractible closed simple curve.
Let $U_\gamma$ be a neighborhood of $\gamma$ that admits a parametrization 
\[\iota\:\RR/\ZZ\times (0,1)\to U_\gamma.\]
\index{Dehn twist}\emph{Dehn twist} along $\gamma$ is a homeomorphism $h\:\Sigma\z\to\Sigma$

\[\iota^{-1}\circ h\circ \iota\:(x,y)\mapsto(x+y,y).\]

If $\Sigma$ is oriented 
and $\iota$ is orientation preserving,
then the Dehn twist described above is called {}\emph{positive}.

\begin{pr}
Let $\Sigma$ be an compact oriented surface with nonempty boundary.

Let $p$ be a point in a topological space $X$.
We say that an open neighborhood $U\ni p$ is \index{conic neighborhood}\emph{conic}
if there is a homeomorphism from a cone
to $U$ that sends its vertex to $p$.

\begin{pr}  
Show that any two conic neighborhoods of one point are homeomorphic to each other.

Note that two cones $\mathop{\rm Cone}(\Sigma_1)$ and $\mathop{\rm Cone}(\Sigma_2)$ might be homeomorphic while $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$ are not;
existence of such examples follow from the double suspension theorem.

\parbf{Immersed disks.}
Both circles on the picture bound essentially different discs.

\medskip

On the first diagram, the dashed lines and the solid lines together bound three embedded discs;
gluing these discs along the dashed lines gives the first immersion.
The reflection of this immersion in the vertical line of symmetry gives an other immersion which is essentially different.

It is a good exercise to count the essentially different discs in the second example. 
(The answer is 5.) 

The existence of examples of that type is generally attributed to John Milnor \cite[see][]{bennequin}.

An easier problem would be to construct two essentially different immersions of annuli with the same boundary curves; a solution is shown on the picture \cite[for more details and references see][]{eppstein-mumford}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Positive Dehn twist.}
Consider the universal covering 
$f\:\tilde\Sigma\z\to\Sigma$.
The surface $\tilde \Sigma$ comes with the orientation induced from $\Sigma$.

%\begin{center}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{47 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-3 mm),b(1 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/dehn()}

\lbl[br]{4,17;$z$}
\lbl[]{33,5;$\tilde \Sigma$}
\end{lpic} 
\end{wrapfigure}
%\end{center}

Fix a point $x_0$ on the boundary $\partial \tilde \Sigma$.
Given two other points $y$ and $z$ in $\partial \tilde \Sigma$ we will write
$z\succ y$ if $y$ lies on the right side from some simple curve from $x_0$ to $z$ in $\tilde\Sigma$.
Note that  $\succ $ defines a linear order on $\partial\tilde\Sigma\backslash\{x_0\}$.
We will write $z \succeq y$ 
if $z\succ y$ or $z=y$.

Note that any homeomorphism $h\:\Sigma\to\Sigma$ that is identity on the boundary
lifts to the unique homeomorphism $\tilde h\:\tilde \Sigma\to\tilde\Sigma$ 
such that $\tilde h(x_0)=x_0$.
The following claim is the key step in the proof. 

\begin{cl}{$({*})$} 
Assume $h$ is a positive Dehn twist along closed curve $\gamma$.
Then $ y\succeq \tilde h(y)$ for any $y\in\partial\tilde\Sigma\backslash\{x_0\}$
and $y_0\succ\tilde h(y_0)$ for some $y_0\in\partial\tilde\Sigma\backslash\{x_0\}$.
\end{cl}



Note that the property in $({*})$ is a homotopy invariant 
and it survives under compositions of maps.
Therefore the problem follows from~$({*})$.

\medskip

If $\Sigma$ is not an annulus,
then by uniformization theorem, we can assume that $\Sigma$ has  hyperbolic metric and geodesic boundary; 
the lifted metric on $\tilde\Sigma$ has the same properties.
Further we can assume that (1) $\gamma$ is a closed geodesic,
(2) the parametrization $\iota\:\RR/\ZZ\times (0,1)\to U_\gamma$ from the definition of Dehn twist is rotationally symmetric 
and (3) for any $u\in \RR/\ZZ$ the arc $\iota(u\times (0,1))$ is a geodesic perpendicular to~$\gamma$. 

Consider the polar coordinates $(\phi,\rho)$ on $\tilde\Sigma$ with the origin at~$x_0$;
since $x_0$ lies on the boundary, the angle coordinate $\phi$ is defined in $[0,\pi]$. 
By construction of Dehn twist, we get 
\[\phi(x)\ge \phi\circ\tilde h(x)\]
for any $x\ne x_0$ 
and if the geodesic $[x_0x]$ crosses $f^{-1}(U_\gamma)$ then 
\[\phi(x)> \phi\circ\tilde h(x).\]
In particular, if $x$ lies on the boundary then $\tilde h(x)$ lies on the right side from the geodesic $[x_0x]$; hence the claim $({*})$ follows.

\end{lpic} 
\end{center}


If $\Sigma$ is an annulus, then the same argument works except we have to choose a flat metric on $\Sigma$.
In this case $\tilde \Sigma$ is a strip between two parallel lines in the plane, see the diagram.

The problem was suggested by Rostislav Matveyev.
It is instructive to solve the following problem.

\begin{pr}
Construct a composition of positive Dehn twists on a compact oriented surface without boundary which is homotopic to the identity. 
\end{pr}




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Conic neighborhood.}
Let $V$ and $W$ be two conic neighborhoods of $p$.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $V\Subset W$;
that is, the closure of $V$ lies in $W$.

We will need to construct a sequence of embeddings $f_n\:V\to W$
such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item 
For any compact set $K\subset V$ 
there is a positive integer $n=n_K$ such that 
$f_n(k)=f_m(k)$ for any $k\in K$ and $m\ge n$.
\item For any point $w\in W$ there is a point $v\in V$ such that $f_n(v)=w$ for all large $n$.
\end{itemize}

Note that once such sequence is constructed, $f\:V\to W$ defined as $f(v)=f_n(v)$ for all large values of $n$ gives the needed homeomorphism.

The sequence $f_n$ can be constructed recursively
\[f_{n+1}=\Psi_n\circ f_n\circ \Phi_n,\]
where $\Phi_n\:V\to V$ 
and $\Psi_n\:W\to W$ 
are homeomorphisms
of the form 
\[\Phi_n(x)=\phi_n(x)\ast x\quad \text{and}\quad \Phi_n(x)=\psi_n(x)\star x,\]
where $\phi_n\:V\to \RR_+$, $\psi_n\:W\to \RR_+$ are suitable continuous functions;
``$\ast$'' and ``$\star$'' denote the {}\emph{multiplication} in the cone structures of $V$ and $W$ correspondingly.\qeds

\parbf{Stabilization.}
The example can be guessed from the diagram.

\medskip

The two sets $K_1$ and $K_2$ are subspaces of the plane 
each is a closed annulus with attached two line segments.
In $K_1$ one segment is attached from inside and the other from the outside and 
in $K_2$ both segments are attached from outside.

}

The product spaces $K_1\times[0,1]$ and $K_2\times[0,1]$ are solid toruses with attached rectangles.
A homeomorphism $K_1\times[0,1]\to K_2\times[0,1]$ can be contrasted by twisting part of one solid torus.

To prove the nonexistence of homeomorphism $K_1\to K_2$ consider the sets of cut points $V_i\subset K_i$ and the sets $W_i\subset K_i$ of points that admit a punctured simply connected neighborhood.
Note that the set $V_i$ is the union of the attached line segments 
and $W_i$ is the boundary of annulus without points where the segments are attached.
Note that $V_i\cup W_i=\partial K_i$;
in particular, a homeomorphism $K_1\to K_2$ (if exists) sends $\partial K_1$ to $\partial K_2$.

Finally note that each $\partial K_i$ has two connected components and 
$V_1$ lies in both components of $\partial K_1$
while $V_2$ lies in one components of $\partial K_2$.
Hence $K_1\ncong K_2$.

I learned this problem from Maria Goluzina around 1988.

\parbf{Homeomorphism of a cube.}
Let us extend the homeomorphism $h$ to whole $\RR^m$ by reflecting the cube in its facets.
We get a homeomorphism say $\tilde h\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ such that $\tilde h(x)=h(x)$ for any $x\in\square^m$ and 
\[\tilde h\circ\gamma=\gamma\circ \tilde h,\]
where $\gamma$ is any reflection in the facets of the cube.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the cube $\square^m$ is inscribed in the unit sphere centered at the origin of $\RR^m$.
In this case $\tilde h$ has \index{displacement}\emph{displacement} at most $2$;
that is, 
\[|\tilde h(x)-x|\le 2\]
for any $x\in\RR^m$.

Fix a smooth increasing concave function $\phi\:\RR\to\RR$ such that

Equip $\RR^m$ with the polar coordinates $(u,r)$, 
where $u\in\mathbb{S}^{m-1}$ and $r\ge 0$.
Consider the open embedding $\Phi\:\RR^m\hookrightarrow\RR^m$

Set

&x&&\text{if}\ |x|\ge 2
\\
&\Phi\circ \tilde h \circ \Phi^{-1}(x)&&\text{if}\ |x|< 2

\right.
\]

It remains to observe that $f\:\RR^m\to\RR^m$ is a solution.

The problem is a stripped from a proof of Robion Kirby \cite[see][]{kirby}.
The condition that face is mapped to face can be removed and 
instead of homeomorphism one can take an embedding that is close to the identity.

An interesting twist to this idea was given by Dennis Sullivan \cite[see][]{sullivan}.
Instead of the discrete group of motions of Euclidean space,
he use a discrete group of motions of hyperbolic space in the conformal disk model.

To see the idea, note that the construction of $\tilde h$ can be done for a Coxeter polytope in the hyperbolic space instead of cube.
Then the constructed map $\tilde h$
coincides with the identity on the absolute and therefore the last ``shrinking'' step in the proof above is not needed.
Moreover, 
if the original homeomorphism is bi-Lipschitz,
then the construction also produce a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism ---
this is the main advantage.

  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Finite topological space.}
Given a point $p\in F$,
denote by $O_p$ the minimal open set in $F$ containing $p$. 
Note that we can assume that $F$ connected $T_0$-space;
in particular, $O_p=O_q$ if and only if $p=q$.

Let us write $p\preccurlyeq q$ 
if $O_p\subset O_q$.
The relation $\preccurlyeq$ is a partial order on~$F$.

Let us construct a simplicial complex $K$ 
by taking $F$ as the set of its vertices
and saying that a collection of vertices form a simplex 
if they can be linearly ordered with respect to $\preccurlyeq$.

Given $k\in K$,
consider the minimal simplex $(f_0,\dots,f_m)\ni k$;
we can assume that $f_0\preccurlyeq \dots\preccurlyeq f_m$.
Set $h\:k\mapsto f_0$;
it defines a map $K\to F$.

It remains to check that $h$ is continuous 
and induces an isomorphism of all the homotopy groups.
\qeds

In a similar fashion, one can construct a finite topological space $F$ for given simplicial complex $K$ 
such that 
there is a weak homotopy equivalence $K\to F$.
Both constructions are due to Pavel Alexandrov
\cite[see][]{alexandrov-finite,mccord}.

\parbf{Dense homeomorphism.}
Note that there is countable set of homeomorphisms $h_1,h_2,\dots$ that is dense in $\mathcal{H}$
such that
each $h_n$ fix all the points outside an open round disc, say $D_n$.

Choose a countable disjoint collection of round discs $D_n'$.
Consider the homeomorphism $h\:\mathbb S^2\to \mathbb S^2$
that fix all the points outside of $\bigcup_nD'_n$ and
for each $n$,
the restriction $h|_{D_n'}$ is conjugate to $h_n|_{D_n}$. 


Note that for large $n$, the homeomorphism $h$ is conjugate to a homeomorphism close to $h_n$.
Therefore $h$ is a solution.
\qeds

The problem was mentioned by Frederic Le Rox \cite[see][]{rox} on a problem section at a conference in Oberwolfach, 
where he also conjectured that this is not true for the area-preserving homeomorphisms.
An affirmative answer to this conjecture was given by Daniel Dore, Andrew Hanlon and Sobhan Seyfaddini 
\cite[see][]{dore-hanlon,seyfaddini}.
In particular it implies the following seemingly evident but nontrivial statement.

\begin{pr}
Given $\eps>0$ there is $\delta>0$ such that 
\[\Omega\cap h(\Omega)\ne\emptyset\]
for any topological disc $\Omega\subset \SSS^3$ with area at least $\eps$
and 
any area-preserving homeomorphism $h\:\SSS^2\to\SSS^2$ with displacement at most $\delta$;
that is, $|h(x)-x|_{\SSS^2}<\delta$ for any $x\in \SSS^2$. 
\end{pr}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Simple path.}
We will give two solution, first is elementary and the second is involved. 

\parit{First solution.}
Let $\alpha$ be a path connecting $p$ to $q$.

Passing to a subinterval if necessary,
we can assume that $\alpha(t)\ne p,q$ for $t\ne0,1$.

An open set $\Omega$ in $(0,1)$ will be called {}\emph{suitable}
if for any connected component $(a,b)$ of $\Omega$ we have $\alpha(a)=\alpha(b)$.
Passing to the union of nested sequence of suitable sets we can find a maximal suitable set $\hat \Omega$;
that is, $\hat \Omega$ suitable and it is not a subset of any other suitable set.

Define $\beta(t)=\alpha(a)$ for any $t$ in a connected component $(a,b)\subset\Omega$.
Note that $\beta$ is continuous and monotonic;
that is, for any $x\in [0,1]$ the set $\beta^{-1}\{\beta(x)\}$ is connected.

It remains to re-parametrize $\beta$ to make it injective.
\qeds

\parit{Second solution.}
Note that one can assume that $X$ coincides with the image of $\alpha$.
In particular $X$ is connected, locally connected, compact Hausdorff space.

Any such space admits a length-metric.
This statement is not at all trivial;
it was conjectured by Karl Menger \cite[see][]{menger}
and proved independently 
by R.~H.~Bing  \cite[see][]{bing-length-0, bing-length-1} 
and Edwin Moise \cite[see][]{moise}.

It remains to consider a geodesic path from $p$ to $q$.
\qeds

The problem inspired by a lemma 
proved by 
Alexander Lytchak
and Stefan Wenger \cite[see 7.13 in][]{lytchak-wenger}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\parbf{Path in a surface.}
Denote the surface by $\Sigma$, assume the path runs from $p$ to $q$.
The following picture suggests an idea for an induction proof on the number of self-crossings.

\lbl[tr]{52.5,2.5;$q$}
\lbl[tr]{91,2.5;$q$}
\end{lpic}
\end{center}

To do the proof formally,
let us present the path as a concatenation $\alpha*\beta$ of two paths  such that $\alpha$ is simple
and $\beta$ does not pass the beginning point $p$.
We can assume that $\beta\:[0,1]\to \Sigma$ is smooth.

Choose a smooth time depending vector field $V_t$ on $\Sigma$ such that
\[V_t(\beta(t))=\beta'(t)\quad\text{and}\quad V_t(p)=0\]
for any $t\in[0,1]$. 

Consider the flow $\Phi^t\:\Sigma\to \Sigma$ along $V_t$;
that is,
\[\Phi^0(x)=x\quad\text{and}\quad \tfrac{d}{dt}(\Phi^t(x))=V_t(\Phi^t(x))\]
for any $t\in[0,1]$ and $x\in \Sigma$.
The map $\Phi^1\:\Sigma\to \Sigma$ is a diffeomorphism;
in particular $\Phi^1$ sends the simple path $\alpha$ to a simple path $\alpha_1=\Phi^1\circ\alpha$.
By construction $\alpha_1(1)=q$. 
Since $V_t(p)=0$ for any $t$, we have $\alpha_1(0)=p$.
That is, the path $\alpha_1$ runs from $p$ to $q$.

It remains to show that $\alpha_1$ is homotopic to $\alpha*\beta$ relative to the ends.
Set $\alpha_\tau=\Phi^\tau\circ\alpha$ and denote by  $\beta_\tau$ the path running along $\beta$ from $\beta(\tau)$ to $q$;
that is, 
\[\beta_\tau(t)=\beta(\tau+\tfrac1{1-\tau}\cdot t).\]
The concatenation $\alpha_\tau*\beta_\tau$ provides a homotopy from $\alpha*\beta$ to $\alpha_1*\beta_1$. 
Since $\beta_1$ is a constant path, $\alpha*\beta$ is homotopic to $\alpha_1$.
Hence the statement follows.

This is a stripped version of the problem suggested by Jaros{\l}aw K\k{e}dra \cite[see][]{One-step}; 
it was used by Michael Khanevsky \cite[see Lemma 3 in][]{khanevsky}.
